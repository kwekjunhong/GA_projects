buildapc,3080 or 6900xt?,"So I'm gonna be building a gaming PC for 4k gaming and in my country I can get a 6900 xt msi trio for the same price as a zotac 3080.
I've never used AMD before so I want to know if it's worth it to get a 6900xt over a 3080?"
buildapc,"Upgrading to a 1440p144Hz setup, would like some final recommendations","**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I am looking to upgrade my (very) old gaming setup to one that can last me for many years. This setup should be able to handle new and old AAA games at 1440p144Hz without issues. Think of games like Forza Horizon 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2, but also VR games like Half-Life Alyx. I want plenty of storage space (with possibility to upgrade for more). Additionally I want a second monitor that I won't play games on, but I want to use that for videos, browsing etc.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

As mentioned above, 1440p144Hz in recent releases is what I'm looking for.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Budget is not that much of an issue except for the fact that I won't go for parts that are much more expensive and perform only marginally better. €2500-3000 would be the limit I think.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

The Netherlands. On this note, I don't have experience with building a computer, so I was wondering if anyone knows shops that assemble your setup in the area of Leiden?

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please).**

The build is based off the exceptional build from [Logical Increments](https://www.logicalincrements.com/). The parts are also chosen with the idea that the setup will last me for many years (e.g. 32GB RAM instead of 16GB).

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I'm looking for feedback on the monitor choice, keyboard and case. 
Since my old setup is really old I am not really familiar with the goto 1440p144Hz monitors, mechanical keyboards and cases (for reference it has a i5 3570k, 8Gb 1333MHz DDR3 RAM, with a MSI Geforce GTX 1060 6GB, on a 1600x900 DVI monitor). I looking on [RTINGS](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/gigabyte/m27q) and this subreddit for recommended monitors. Since I want a dual monitor setup where the second monitor is not used for games, I was wondering if a 1440p144Hz second monitor is considered overkill or not.

The case choice I went with is the recommended on from Logical Increments. But maybe people are very enthusiastic about another case and if that is the case I am very curious to hear that!

For keyboards I looked through /r/MechanicalKeyboards for recommendations. I would like to get a full, white keyboard since this would match with the case. The Ducky One 2 seems to be a good keyboard but I had difficulty finding a fullsized keyboard in the white colour. Therefore I went with the Corsair K70 RGB MK.2 SE at the moment but it seems a little expensive so I'm looking for alternatives.

One last question I had is that PCPartPicker mentions that ""The be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4 50.5 CFM CPU Cooler may require a separately available mounting adapter to fit the Gigabyte Z690 UD DDR4 ATX LGA1700 Motherboard."" Does anyone know anything about this?"
buildapc,Help fine tune my build before it's final.,"My 2500k/980 build is on it's knees and about to give up the ghost so i'm planning the build below: [https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/WjsfMv](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/WjsfMv). I'm in the UK and housebound so use my PC a lot for games, a little work and connecting with family and friends. The most demanding tasks are games and I do like to have lots of programes open (skype, discord, Chrome tabs x 10) on 3 screens.

Not used PC partpicker before so quick overview:

* 12700k
* Noctua NH-D15
* MSI Pro Z690 Gaming X DDR 4
* Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB DDR4-3600 CL 18
* WD Blue SN550 2TB NVME
* GTX 3080 10GB Founders (already bought)
* Fractal Design Torrent (mid tower)
* Seasonic Focus PX 850 80+ Platinum
* Win 11
* Cost is just over £2,000.

I really liked the look of the Fractal Design 7 case and the extra USB ports on the front but is the Torrent a better idea for better cooling/efficient/quiet? I love the idea of a quieter system when I'm just working or watching Netflix rather than gaming. I have some neurological issues that make me hyper sensitive to noise. Or would it be worth paying more to go for the Fractal Design 7? I think it would be about £50 more expensive because of the extra fans I'd need (the Torrent includes fans). I don't need more than what they include for the Torrent right? 2 front &amp; 3 on the bottom. 

I had planned a cheaper build but got such a good deal on a 3080 Founders decided to treat myself a little as life has been quite hard the past few years and I use my PC a lot each day.

I'm currently using a 2nd hand ultrawide 1440/1080p 29"" LG, my 2011 24"" 60hz Asus and a free 17"" Acer but am a bit overwhelmed by monitor choices. Are there an obvious 2-3 options for 1440p 240hz to keep an eye on a deal for? I've resisted buying so far because it just gets too confusing and I read so much about issues people have.

Any feedback is gratefully received as I'm no more than a week or two from pulling the trigger and would really appreciate knowing this is a good build I can enjoy for the next few years.

Only slight niggle is the motherboard only has support for 2.0 sound but my solution for linking it up with my Logitech Z906 5.1) is to buy a £10 s/pdif cable rather than spend £50-60 more for a motherboard with 5.1 sound support.

I had originally intended to add the 4TB HD from my old build but am thinking a caddy might be best to use for backup so keep the system quieter. I've had a lot of trouble with Win 10 updates and it has required various reinstalls but I'm hoping Win 11 is better than this. Or is it worth getting another SSD for the OS?"
buildapc,Need help picking out a KVM or other solution to swap between work laptop and my personal PC as easily as possible.,"As the tittle says, im looking for a KVM switch solution or something else that would allow me to switch between my personal pc and work laptop.

Is there a KVM switch or other solution that would support all of this?

buildapc,Ryzen 5 3600 + GT 710 or Ryzen 3 3200G,"Hello! So unfortunately my old GPU died last week. I've been considering purchase a GT 710 for 75$ just because the R5 3600 doesnt have it own iGPU, however i spotted a Ryzen 3 3200G for 93$ yesterday.

buildapc,Advice on GPU Temps,"Hi, I’ve got a 3090 in an NR200p max. I use the mesh side panel. I get 3 temps reported for the GPU. Two of them are around 80C during game if (which I assume is fine).

buildapc,Would this be the cause of my pc slowing down?,"Image here of my ram sticks https://ibb.co/NrzrvYC

I had one CL10 stick of ram in channel 1/slot 1 for years. Recently got my hands on 2x of the CL9. I put one in channel 2/slot 2 and another in channel 3.
Firstly Windows only detected 16gb as I have home edition. But my computer was horrendously slow. I couldnt use steam and Firefox at once. I tried reinstalling windows and still the same.
I didn't realise the sticks were different models but the specs looked the same.
I took the CL10 out and put the CL9 sticks in slot 1 and 2 and things seem far better now.

Can someone please explain what happened?
Thanks!"
buildapc,Am I calculating GPU clearance correctly?,"So Lian Li's website says their O11 air mini has a GPU clearance of 362mm. I will have a front mounted AIO nzxt x63 in this case in a push config. So it seems the radiator's depth is 30mm and the 6700xt I'm planning to get has a length of 320mm. 

Would that mean I will only have 12mm of clearance?  (362-30 = 332mm, 332-320 = 12 mm)

Or do I have to include the AIO push fan depth as well? If my clearance is correct, should I instead aim for a smaller GPU for better airflow?

So far I've gotten pretty 50/50 opinions saying my incoming GPU will/will not fit with my other soon to arrive parts. Noob here pls help ty."
buildapc,PSU wattage enough?,"Got myself in a bit of a pickle here... long story short I bought components for a new build around black friday aiming to use it with a 3060Ti if I ever got my hands on one. Didn't manage to get the 3060Ti but got my hands on a 3080Ti FE... I think my PSU is undersized and I should upgrade?

buildapc,Buy new memory for 12900K?,"Hi all,

Just switched from an 3800X to a new 12900K, as I got a great deal on the CPU ($560).

I bought the Asus Z690 TUF D4 (DDR4 memory option) and decided to use my old memory from my AMD system.

So right now I have 2 x 16GB G.Skill DDR4-3200 / F4-3200C14D-32GTZR [LINK](https://www.gskill.com/specification/165/166/1536653655/F4-3200C14D-32GTZR-Specification), which I believe is Samsung B-Die memory. I wanted to overclock my AMD system, but I never really got around to it.

It seems to work just fine using the XMP1 setting (whatever that is), running at 3200Mhz. Although I see many opt for faster 4000-4800Mhz, with slower timings.

Now that I have that beast of a CPU, I just want to have the best performance possible from my memory as well. I do not plan on overclocking past what Multicore Enhancement is doing already, so I guess more or less stock settings, with a twist here and there.

**Question:** should I buy new memory for my Intel 12900K? And in such case, which memory kit should I go for? Must be 32GB at least.

Thanks for your replies in advance :-)"
buildapc,Will a H710 case fit a EVGA 1600w PSU?,"Anyone know? 

It looks like it will but this PSU is a pain, YES it's overkill but it was purchased for a very specific reason (which it did very very well) and then was no longer needed so I simply kept it because it's a very good PSU and I see no reason to replace it and create waste.

The only issue is it can struggle to fit in some cases so I promised next time I change case I'll double check to see if anyone knows.

Thanks all."

Now if I went down the route of an amd gpu instead would I lose much performance for not having an amd built system and cpu?

buildapc,Could anybody help me spec out an architecture workstation for my wife?,"Hi guys,

I'm a longterm desktop user using a pretty lightweight Linux PC that I specced out myself years ago (though the shop assembled).

My wife works as a professional (and self employed) architect. She's currently using a Microsoft laptop. By dint of perseverance, I'm slowing wearing her down and making her see the merits of switching over to a desktop/workstation. She works long hours and I know that for ergonomics and expandability reasons, a desktop is a better way to go long term.

She currently uses: : Microsoft Surface Book 2 (Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB) - 15"" (I presume the 1TB = SSD). Here's what she says about the programs she uses:

&gt;""By far the most resource intensive is currently Vray for Rhino (Rhino is the 3D design program, Vray is the rendering add-on).  
&gt;  
&gt;After that, Revit is very heavy, but I am not currently using it. Sketchup is also very heavy, but I hope to use that less.  
&gt;  
&gt;After those, Adobe Suite, especially InDesign, is very heavy.  
&gt;  
&gt;After that probably Autocad - it's not bad, unless you use a lot of hatches.""

Here's what I'm thinking:

* Beefy GPU and a good PSU to fire it
* 32GB RAM (perhaps 64GB to be more future proof)
* No change to storage but maybe throw in a really big HDD for archiving

Anything I'm missing?

Thanks much!"

I have got down to 3 options so far T-Force Dark Z Alpha (Hynix 3600 18CL), T-Force Xtreme (Samsung 3200 14CL - $100 more than dark z alpha)  and T-Force Xtreme (Samsung 3600 14CL - $170 more than dark z alpha) for ryzen 5900x. Is it worth it to invest in lower CL? I need the machine to work with good stability without any overclocking at minimum. If it can be good with oc for future also, much better.

shouldn't it show something like 1.3v ish not 3v?

Could it be the PPT EDC TDC (125w, 90a, 120a) values that I manually set caused this? (VDD in bios is set to auto). + undervolt -.115mv (so in bios CPU voltage shows 0.900v).

So far it didn't cause any problem (in Cinebench R23 multi score went from 14500(stock) to 15500(after undervolt and manually changed values, CPU temp went down from 77c to 70c on full load).

Problem: screen freeze everywhere other than BIOS interface, even freeze in safe mode, during system install, etc. Rarely, there will be a blue error screen with DPC Watchdog Violation error code.

Tried methods: reinstall Windows, replace MB, Memory, GPU, SSD

Yesterday, I restarted my desktop (which has not been turn off for monthes), and my computer start getting some random Freeze. I thought it was caused the windows update so I decided to reinstall the system, but the freeze is still happening after the reinstall. 

At this point, i think it's my hardware failure, i changed to a new MB, still freezeing; changed to a new SSD, still freezeing; changed with memory from my other desktop, still freezing; changed with gpu from my other desktop, still freezeing.

So I am currently have a computer with my original CPU and PSU, every other component is new or from my other computer, the SSD is new without installed system, i am still having screen freeze when i start the computer. I am trying to install windows on the new SSD, but most of the time the screen freeze at the windows spinning, sometimes it can get into windows install interface, but will freeze in a short time.

I do not have a CPU today to test if it is the reason cause the freeze and i will try that tomorrow, but i am worried that a new CPU won't fix the freeze, then i really don't know that to do.

I hope to hear any reason which may cause the screen freeze and hope to know what is wrong with my computer. Thank you in advance."
buildapc,Nzxt H710i and Asus Proart X570 without using the smart device possible?,"First build in 11 years. Could use some advice.

Planning a build in the NZXT H710i without using the smart device, since I like the case asthetic but I can't get a non-i version in my country without importing.

Can I connect the case's 3 front fans and 1 rear fan to the Asus ProArt X570 motherboard directly? The mobo's manual shows it has 4 chassis fan headers so I assume yes. 

The 3 front fans are daisychained though. Does this mean I just take the third fan's cable and plug it into a single fan header? Or do I use Y-splitters on that last daisychained fan to plug it into 3 separate fan headers?

There are 2 LED strips in the case. The X570 mobo has a couple of LED headers. Do I plug the strips into those headers to turn them on without the smart device? My plan is to use OpenRGB software to control them to change color to yellow, if possible. If not, then white light is enough.

Thanks for reading!"

Anyways, I have two 3090s I'd like to use on this build unless I can get my hands on a couple 3090 TIs when they come out.  I need motherboard suggestions.

buildapc,Xbox series x controller or the Dualsense for my PC?,"I have saved up some money for my first controller that I will be using for my gaming PC.

3. Which feels better in my (very sweaty) hands (Personally, extremely important)
4. Nicer buttons and Heavy Duty.

buildapc,Auto driver updater for Windows 11 pro?,"Sorry for the noob question, I just built my first pc. So, These last 2 and a half hours I've been trying to update all of my new pc's drivers....... I really wish there was an auto update feature or a list that would show me which drivers to update that would'nt require me to go search for drivers on the internet for each single component of my pc.... Device management unfortunately dosen't show the latest updates, I have been able to find much more recent drivers through the internet. I have a msi board, intel 12thgen cpu, corsair rams, and msi rtx 3070 ti ventus graphics card. I know that they have different manufacturers so I abandoned the dream of having a single program that will deal with all these drivers's updates, but maybe each manufacturer has their own auto updaters??? Please help me, I am extremely overwhelmed....."

buildapc,Help with deciding on motherboard/cooler and finalizing build~,"Hello! I finally managed to score a 3080 and was wondering if this build was a good idea to pull the trigger on. I was also wondering what fans/cpu aftercooler would be a good idea, I've heard a lot of good things about bequiet and Noctua.

buildapc,Is it safe to use CPU cooler without mounting?,"I ordered a Dark Rock Pro 4 cooler along with all of my other components for my new 12700k build and was completely unaware that they were not shipping with lga-1700 brackets (4 months after the chip launch sick). I'm afraid that if I don't test my components now for defects i'll miss my window for refunds. So the question is, could I get away with placing my PC horizontally and letting gravity keep the heat sink attached to the CPU? I figured thermal paste would help as a sort of adhesive. Is this a bad idea? The projected shipping time for the replacement bracket is around 2 weeks and many online have complained that these companies are taking even longer and they aren't able go track the shipment. I haven't built a system since 2014 so i'm incredibly terrified i'm going all out on a system that may have a defective mobo or ram or something."
buildapc,"Been using a 3080ti with a 650w PSU (No issues yet, but...)","Just wondering if this is generally going to be an issue in the long run? Had no problems so far and I've been using it for a week, benchmarking and games present no problems. I know spending that much on a GPU then cheaping out on the PSU may seem like an odd choice, but I've watched 10+ videos looking at full system power draw and none of them ever go above 600w total, with most around 500-550 (Using i5 12600k).

It's a CX-650F which on the tier list comes in at Tier B. I'd built the system over the course of a few months and got this PSU as I intended on getting a 3070, but got a fairly decent deal on a 3080ti in the end.

I understand most of the replies will probably tell me to get a better, higher wattage PSU, but from a technical standpoint, surely if the power draw never goes about 600w on a 650w PSU, and a fairly well built one at that, it won't be an issue?"
buildapc,Lower than expected 11900F performance?,"Hey

I was hoping someone would know the answer to this.

I have bought this cpu now and have owned it for over a month. I have been watching game benchmark videos and have tried the same games on my PC with a 30 fps difference! This included Watch Dogs Legion which struggled to get past 50fps. When using rivatuner to monitor usage this shows the GPU at 60%use but CPU far higher.

I have did a test via GeekBench this morning and both my single and multi core performance are significantly lower than they should be (1686 single core and 6694 multi core).

I know for certain that this isn’t an overheating issue as the cooler is well more than capable and the temperatures never exceed 70 degrees under 100 load.

is there anything you can suggest to try to see why I am getting such a low level of performance?

One thing to add is I was watching CoreTemp during this and the cpu never passed 100W which seems low considering it peaks at 260W. Any way to fix this?

My RAM as well is exceptionally poor but surely this wouldn’t have a massive knock on to the level it is? Or could it be my SSD but everything is mainly on the NVMe one?

could it be something stupid I’ve done ie not changed something in BIOS? Or do I need to unlock power limits in my bios if so how do I go about changing the right settings?

buildapc,would it be better to spend the extra cash on an ssd with dram or a dram-less ssd but with higher storage?,"all in all, 500Gb is enough really but more storage wouldn't hurt. Speed isn't also my issue since I'm coming from an HDD. **All I'm really prioritizing is longevity (this includes how long the component will last and the warranty they provide for it).** 

So you could say that maybe the brand is a factor here including their reputation and customer service, and also the quality of the product.

&amp;#x200B;

While were at it maybe you could recommend an m.2 pcie compatible ssd under 90 bucks (but my budget is really just 60 bucks)?"

buildapc,Cooler for i5-11400f?,Hi so basically Im building a pc. I dont want to overlclock as im only planning to play 1080p  144fps. What cooler would be good for the 11400f? Would a single fan air cooler be enough thanks!!!
buildapc,Advice needed and probably some stupid questions,"Hi Everyone, this might be a long read not sure yet.  
A quick few points:  
\-I live in South Africa  
\-Last time I build &amp; owned  a PC was 12years ago  
\-Currently own a PS5  
Wanting to build a PC again, I've been lurking the posts for about 2weeks and catching up on everything.  
Its difficult to give a budget, a $1000 build will cost me probably $2000 (sad noises). Example a i5 12600k on special cost $391.49, normal price $469.79.  


I'm looking for a PC mainly just to game, obviously the general browsing and streaming services to. I don't live stream, I don't do any editing.

I would like a build that I can play on 1440p(if that is the new norm) with decent settings that will last me a few years until I can save up to do upgrades. Not sure about OC,maybe after a read some more.  
I play a mix of games, God of War, Warzone, Gta, Horizon Zero Dawn..... AAA games  


So to get to my questions:

\-Do I need a I5 or I7?

\-Do I wait for AMD 7000 series

\-Do I buy piece by piece(cases,ram,PSU....) or save until I can afford everything 

\-Do I buy everything now and wait to buy a GPU ( Even before the GPU crisis our launch price for 3060 was starting at $650, this will always a stupid price in SA no matter what )  
   
Will add more Q when they pop up, sneaking this post in while I'm at work"
buildapc,MY PC BUILD JOURNEY,"Hey everyone, Today was D-Day when
 I finally got my PC built. I have been researching for it since September 2021, Started with a budget of $1084.54 and After all the hustle Here It is for 3x the price. I have been watching a lot of reviews and reading a lot of discussions lately and I had like to thank this amazing community of Tech Enthusiasts for spreading all the useful knowledge and helping me to make all the decisions. Therefore I had like to contribute to the community as well and would love to do my bit, that is why I am sharing my PC Configuration and feel free to ask anything about my decision making about a particular part or any other query that you may have. Also I would request the others who do not have any questions to please share your opinions on the build.

NOTE (1):- My PC was built yesterday i.e. 12th January, and I haven’t booted it up for the first time yet because I haven’t bought my monitor yet. I would be going for a MSI MAG274QRF-QD which is the best High end 1440p 144hz IPS 1ms gaming monitor available in my area. I tried to check If I can get the ASUS XG27AQ but Unfortunately that is not available and I guess Asus has not launched that particular mode in India as when I checked the ROG Monitor section on the Asus webite It only listed 4 monitors and not the XG27AQ. So Since I haven’t check the performance yet I won’t be able to comment on it either atleast as of now.

Intel i7 12700KF $467.71

Asus ROG STRIX Z690A GAMING WIFI $427.04

MSI SUPRIM X RTX 3070Ti $1315.01

G Skill TridentZ RGB 32 GB (2x16) 3600 MHz C18 KIT $187.08

WD Blue SN570 1TB Gen 3 SSD $108.45

CORSAIR iCue H150i Elite Cappelix White $214.20

CORSAIR RM850 80 Plus Gold Fully Modular Black $154.55

Corsair iCUE 5000X White $220.98
 
Total Build Cost $3088.24

NOTE (2):- I have converted all the prices in USD from INR as I live in India and I think USD would be more convinient to everybody here.

I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY A GENERAL QUERY THAT I DID THINK ABOUT. 
Q. Why did you not wait for RTX 4000 series or the Ryzen 7 Gen or something something..

A. I had it in mind to get a PC build since 5 years and Lately When I got the chance to get my PC built I decided to not rush any decision and think of every step beforehand. Though I almost did rush into it a few times and almost paid for something i might regret today but somehow those didn’t work out. So honestly whatever happened it did happen for the best. Though after all the wait of the new 12th gen cpu’s and z690 mobo I saw that the budget wasn’t enough and Luckily I was able to get the required funds after getting a great deal. But why not wait furthermore, So Honestly I wasn’t sure If I would get the funds later on so I decided to go for the best deal I could get so far. Also Even If You do not have that issue and you are still confused if you should wait or not I had say depends on your urgency if you don’t care at all and can wait for the new gen sure go ahead but mind the availability aspect as well. Otherwise I would say that all of this is technology it never stays the best and it keeps on upgrading every now and then so Don’t strees too much if you want it go for it. 

Lastly I have posted the picture of the build If anyone is interested to check it out here is the link: https://imgur.com/a/KCY73sm"
buildapc,Would this build work with a RTX 3060/ 3060 ti?,"I plan on buying a prebuilt from eBay with no GPU. My thinking is I can save a bit of money on a decent prebuilt and stay in my $1200-$1300 budget. The build I’m looking at also has no storage but that’s fine. I know absolutely nothing about PCs and have only recently gotten into reading everything about them in the last 2 days or so. so I guess I’m mostly asking if I’ll run into any overheating or compatibility issues putting a 3060 (or maybe a 3060 ti) in here? I’ve watched Warzone videos of this cpu/gpu combo and I’m just wondering  about the other parts before I pull the trigger.
God I hope this formats correctly lol:

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700x 3.6 GHz 8-core processor

buildapc,Is my PSU faulty?,"I just built my first ever PC and as I've been trying to test it, it keeps getting caught in a boot loop or just shutting down with the PSU making a clicking noise each time (it can last between 2 seconds to 2 minutes before doing this).

Im getting the same result and have no idea how to fix this considering everything i have is new and the cpu, ram and fans all seem to be working adequately.

I also thought that this could be a result of the b550 motherboard not supporting my cpu, but i cant update the bios with it powering off like this so I'm at a complete loss here.

buildapc,What PSU to buy,"Ive been looking at a 750w psu to suit my RX 6600 XT but dont know the difference between an 80+ bronze and a 80+ gold. The price is significantly higher for a gold but dont know what to get. Is the computer performance for each type different or is it just different power intake to output efficiency. If there is no performance gain to having a gold/ platinum then i might just stick to the 80+ bronze.

buildapc,XFX Merc319 6900xt cards,"Hi,

I am planning to buy one of XFC's RX 6900XT cards, specifically black edition ones. Looking into their website, they list several different options:

*  **XFX Speedster MERC 319 AMD Radeon™ RX 6900 XT Black**  RX-69XTATBD9 
*  **XFX Speedster MERC 319 AMD Radeon™ RX 6900 XT Black**  RX-69XTACBD9 
*  **XFX Speedster MERC 319 AMD Radeon™ RX 6900 XT Limited Black**  RX-69XTACSD9 

Now I am a bit confused about them and looking for an advice: what is the difference between the 2 non limited black cards? As far as I can tell it's only that one of them has an USB-C port instead of one DP port. Is this the only difference or is there something more to it?

Then there is a black limited edition card. As far as I understand the limited black is designed to be overclocked (and also has higher speeds out of the box). Now, I will be pairing this GPU with AIO cooled 5900X on a B550 board inside Thermaltake Core V21 case, so there might be just not enough airflow to properly cool the card if I ever want to overclock it. 

I can get the non USB-C model for roughly 1690 eur here, while limited edition is around 1820 eur. For reference (in case someone suggests i get 6800 xt), the cheapest 6800xt costs 1400eur (MSI Gaming Z Trio), while XFX Merc model is more expensive than 6900 xt at over 1700 eur, and XFX core around 1500 eur.

Should I get the non USB-C model?

Should I try finding the USB-C model?

Should I go with Black limited edition?

Should I not get any of these cards and look for something else (I'd like to at least get a 3080, but those  start at 2000 eur here)?

Thank you for your help."

I don’t want to touch any of the front intake fans though, because they came with the case and configuring them was a pain, since their cables are just barely long enough to reach the mobo headers rn, and even connecting that was a pain."

This this is blue-screening like hell. I suspect the memory might be bad, as this is happening at all base settings, minus turning on the TPM setting for Windows 11. No XMP, no OC anywhere. I’ve reset CMOS multiple times and reinstalled windows multiple times. Ran all the updates and tried latest drivers and old versions. No dice. Sometimes I can’t even log into windows before a BSOD. I need help with things to try. New DDR5 ram is hard to get so I really want to get this thing working. Maybe more memory voltage? But there are so many settings idk which ones to do. Memory OC is uncharted territory for me."

buildapc,Help With Applications Randomly Crashing &amp; Blue Screens,"**Intro**

As the title says, I've been struggling to figure out what has been going on with my computer lately.  It started out almost a month ago as some freezing/crashing in Skyrim that I attributed to conflicting mods.  Soon, though, I stopped getting error notifications and pop-ups, and was simply crashing to desktop - playing one second, then the next looking at the screen as if I'd never booted the game.  I still thought ""eh, just skyrim mods acting up.""

Then, it expanded to Mtg:Arena crashing to desktop with no error message, which I figured was some bug of that client as it could sometimes be finicky.  However, searching the MTGA subreddit, I found almost no one else having a problem with the client.  This lead me to believe that it might be on my end.  This was around a week before Christmas, so somewhere around 12/18/21-12/20/21...ish.  I don't exactly remember when this all started, because it was less frequent then and not as pervasive.

Since that week leading up to Christmas, though, the problem has only worsening and hitting everywhere.  I get crashes in about anything that I do - from gaming, to FireFox tabs, and anything else I might use - and have even gotten a couple of BSODs.  Sometimes I do get error messages (more on that later), more often I don't, but across everything I can find no common thread so I'm not sure what the problem is.

My guess is hardware, but as I've tried troubleshooting more and more without success, my google searches have started turning up the same results and the well seems to be running dry.  So I'm posting this in hopes of finding something useful specific to my situation.  I'm sure the answer is out there somewhere, but I'm too dense to connect the dots and put it all together, so I'd appreciate anyone else's help getting me there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Specs**

I built this computer a bit over a year ago now, and have had absolutely no issues up until now.  There are a couple extra fans etc in there, but this is the core of the build:

***CPU***: AMD Ryzen 5 3600x 3.8 GHz 6-Core Processor

***MOBO***: ASRock B550 Pro4 ATX AM4 Motherboard

***Memory***: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory

***Storage***: Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive

***GPU***: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 8GB Founders Edition Video Card

***PSU***: EVGA SuperNOVA GA 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply

***Case***: Fractal Design Meshify C ATX Mid Tower Case

&amp;#x200B;

**Issues I've Encountered**

Applications crash to desktop with no error message (very common)

*Sometimes can happen within five minutes of starting a game, sometimes can go an hour or two without a problem.  Seems very random, however has definitely been increasing in regularity as time goes on.*

&amp;#x200B;

Firefox tabs randomly crashing

*-Browser itself stays up, but individual tab will have a ""something went wrong"" message*

&amp;#x200B;

Games crashing with an accompanying Event Viewer log

*-Very often mention a problem with Unity.dll, sometimes with ntdll.dll / xul.dll / etc.*

*-Didn't start occurring until after a week or two of the crashes*

*-See pastebin links at bottom of post for Event Viewer transcripts*

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Screens of Death.  Messages I've gotten include:

*-IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL (several times)*

*-Unexpected\_Kernel\_Mode\_Trap (only once)*

*-System\_Service\_Exception (only once)*

*-See pastebin links at bottom of post for WINDbg transcripts of .dmp files*

&amp;#x200B;

**Things I've Tried**

It's been a bit since I started troubleshooting this, but I'll try to remember everything...

\-Uninstalled &amp; reinstalled games, verified files thru Steam, etc.

\-Rolled back NVIDIA driver, as I saw there was a new one released on 12/20/21, which was right around when this started.  However, rolling back drivers (even using DDU to remove everything and do a clean install) didn't fix.  Tried previous 2 patches to be safe.

\-Played games with nvidia overlay turned off

\-Changed 3D settings to ""maximum performance"" in nvidia control panel

\-Changed RAM from XMP profile back to default settings; went back to XMP-enabled after failed to fix

\-Windows Memory Test &amp; memtest, passed all attempts.  To be safe, eventually even got my hands on new RAM and swapped out to no avail, so swapped back to original RAM \[Unsure if worth noting or not, new RAM was exact same model as my current RAM, just brand new.\]

\-Formatted hard drive &amp; did a fresh install of Windows. \[reinstalled all drivers etc as needed\]

\-Swapped GPU with a 3060 and played on that for a while, still crashing

\-Verify windows files through cmd prompt 'sfc /scannow' at multiple times throughout this ordeal.

\-Checked hard drive health with SMART test through cmd prompt, as well as through CrystalDisk (snip of screen at bottom of post)

\-Flashed BIOS update from version 1.2 to 2.1

*It's worth noting that I have had HWInfo on my computer since building it a year ago, and was always comfortably in healthy temp ranges.  However, since updating bios, the summary screen here now isn't picking up actual temps but is just defaulting to really low values.  However, since everything in that regard has been fine up until now, I'm not particularly worried about this as a cause.  Maybe just something wacky going on with the sensors right now.*

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm sure there's a few more things here and there I can't recall, but that's the main portion.  I feel like it's not software related as I've formatted &amp; reinstalled everything, tried multiple versions of my GPU drivers, etc.  So that leaves hardware.  However, I've also tested swapping out RAM, swapping out GPU, and not getting anything there.  Tests seem to support nothing wrong with SSD.

I'm unsure how to test for CPU/MOBO/PSU issues, but from process of elimination that's all that I really have left.  (Or, just as likely, there is an issue somewhere else that I think I've cleared but in reality just failed to detect and need help finding.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I'm starting to pull my hair out with frustration b/c this is so pervasive, affecting any use of the computer from listening to music/videos during the day while working due to Firefox crashing, to not being able to play any sort of game that isn't easily rejoinable due to the application crashes.  And then whenever the blue screens come around I start to get extra scared.

I just built this a year ago and reallyyyy don't want to be dealing with any crazy problems right now, but feel like I'm at the end of the line for ""easy"" fixes.  At this point, I've put so much time &amp; effort trying to troubleshoot over the past few weeks that even if it is something more dire, at least clearly identifying the problem and knowing how to fix it will be such a relief, even if it costs a little money.

Sorry if this whole post is too lengthy, but I figured it'd be better to err on the side of too much info rather than too little.  A million heartfelt thanks to anyone who takes time to help me; it is very appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Error Logs, etc**

Unfortunately, due to the Windows reinstall I did on January 3rd, I don't have any logs of these problems as they were developing; just from 1/3/22 onward.  But I'll share what I have here.  And keep in mind, for every example shown here, there are more that I'm not showing b/c I don't want to be TOO redundant; and for each one of THOSE that I'm not showing, there are many, many more that didn't generate a log at all.

buildapc,Blue screen when I upgraded the RAM of my Dell G15 Gaming Laptop,"Hi!

Recently, I've bought my first ever gaming laptop. The specs are as follows: Dell G15 5510, 10th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10500H, NVIDIA(R) GeForce(R) GTX 1650 4GB GDDR6, 8GB DDR4 2933MHz.

Since it has an additional RAM slot, I decided to purchase an extra 8GB RAM to have a total of 16GB memory. So I purchased this: [https://imgur.com/WClW2bj](https://imgur.com/WClW2bj) and installed it on my extra RAM slot.

But immediately after that, blue screen appeared while booting up my laptop. Different error codes appeared. See them here:

[https://imgur.com/IAcBiDn](https://imgur.com/IAcBiDn)

[https://imgur.com/6ALkOS5](https://imgur.com/6ALkOS5)

Some of the troubleshooting steps that I did: 

1. Swapped the first RAM to the new RAM. Blue screen.
2. Used only the new RAM, removed the first RAM. Blue screen.
3. Gently cleaned the new RAM using eraser, still blue screen.

And so I decided to just remove the new RAM. Laptop returned back to normal, no errors, no bootup problems. I will be returning it to the store.

I took a photo of my laptop's RAM. [https://imgur.com/QP2zqvS](https://imgur.com/QP2zqvS) Both are 3200mhz and SK Hynix brand. The only difference I see is 1Rx8 and 1Rx16. The laptop RAM is 1Rx16. The newly purchased RAM is 1Rx8. Could this be the reason why the upgrade cannot be done? Are these two RAMs not compatible with each other? 

What should I do? Should I repurchase a new RAM with the same 1Rx16? 

Please help a noob laptop user. All your comments are appreciated! Thank you!"

buildapc,Two RAID arrays with MPG Z390 Gaming Edge AC Okay?,"Hi all,

Currently in my PC, I have a 1TB m.2 SSD as my boot drive and 3 WD Red 1TB HDDs in a RAID 0 array for extra storage. I wanted to increase my fast storage for games that load slow because I play a lot of modpacks that both use a ton of storage and bog load times down.

Now, my motherboard is an MSI MPG Z390 Gaming Edge AC, it has 2 m.2 slots so I ordered an identical m.2 SSD and my plan is to take this second SSD and put it in another RAID 0 array with the current one.  but I wanted to see if anyone has tried this and if there's any pitfalls or things I should know about? I know RAID can be finicky sometimes so I just want to see if anyone has an additional insight into this. I'm using the BIOS to make the RAID arrays, if that makes any difference.

Thanks!"
buildapc,"Had a new CPU (3700X) die on me while idle, which is rare. Should I replace the cheap motherboard (B450M) too, even though it seems to be working fine? I don't trust it or the PSU any longer (already bought replacement PSU).","Seems like a tough call, maybe someone here ran across a rule of thumb for this kind of situation? Often in maintenance/repair, if (A) fails, you replace (B), (C), etc. too.

The CPU only had a handful of hours on it, was running just fine until it suddenly died while computer was almost idle (actually just typing a Google search). No adverse events that I know of (storms/power surges/etc.).

CPU has since been replaced under warranty and system is running fine again (for 20 minutes anyway).

Given how rare CPU failure like this is, I suspect that the PSU (EVGA 600D) and/or MB (ASRock B450M/ac) killed it. I already bought a decent quality replacement PSU, wondering if I should also buy a new motherboard or risk keeping this one. I'm afraid the PSU or MB may have intermittent voltage spikes or other dangerous transients.

More details, just in case:

I would never put a good CPU into a system that might have already killed one like this. All I knew for sure after my own troubleshooting was that the CPU was dead but the PSU was outputting correct voltages under a light load. (RAM, GPU, SSD were also good). The original builder declined to replace either the PSU or MB and I don't know their testing protocol. I'm guessing they just popped a new CPU in, the system booted, and they shipped it back. (Normally I do my own builds, but this was the only way I could get a new GPU at the time.) I have like 2 months warranty remaining on system (it sat unused for months)."
buildapc,I Can't Get a Simple Rebuilt to Show Video,"To preface: I've built countless PCs and have troubleshooted many as well. Now, a friend of mine had a PC that he had built within the past decade. It is rather old. It has an Intel CPU installed. I am not sure what one it is. He has an nVidia 760 Ti and 2 SSDs. Yesterday, he showed me that it can boot to the BIOS. He couldn't figure out to get an operating system onto it. I am not personally even sure if he ever was able to get an operating system onto it. He claims that his problem occurred when he tried to set up 2 120GB SSDs in RAID and couldn't get it to work. It has apparently been a year since he tried this, and the PC has been out of commission since. I saw with my own eyes that the PC was able to boot into the BIOS yesterday. I told him I would take it home, but it in a more modern case, clear the CMOS, upgrade the BIOS, and install an OS on his SSDs and set it all up properly. Here I am now, roughly 24 hours later: I have the PC installed in the new case, fantastic cable management now completed, especially compared to what it was coming from. His SSDs were flopping around in the previous 12 year old case, drowned in a nest of wires. There are 6 DIMM slots on his motherboard (ASUS Sabertooth X58) and he had 5x8GB sticks installed in 5/6 of the slots with a random 4GB stick added into the 6th slot. SOMEHOW THIS WAS BOOTING. Now, with my proper assembly and configuration (Max RAM is 24GB TOTAL on this board. A1, B1, and C1 slots ONLY are called for and are the only slots in use for a standard 24GB max triple channel RAM config) I cannot get any idea to display. There is no built in integrated graphics option with the board and I had grounded my person during the case swap. No damage could have came to neither the GPU nor the motherboard in this process. Neither the CPU nor the CPU heatsink was removed during the process either.

I cannot figure out what the problem here is. I have attempted individual RAM seating and configs, reseated all components except for the CPU and heatsink, which were babied and untouched during the rebuild, cleared the CMOS, and utilized the board's proprietary safe-mem fail proof boot button on the board (lol), but to no avail.

Thanks so much in advance everyone."
buildapc,"Finally upgrading from my first build, what do you all think about my plans for my next?","Finally feeling the need to upgrade from my first PC build.

Eventually upgraded it after a while with an SSD. But my biggest problem other than it being pretty slow nowadays, is that with AMD's final release of software last year for this card, it really the end of it's lifecycle. Still gonna keep it, maybe use it in the living room or something. But need to upgrade.

buildapc,MSI MAG B660 Tomahawk vs ASRock B660 Steel Legend?,"[MAG B660 Tomahawk WIFI DDR4](https://us.msi.com/Motherboard/MAG-B660-TOMAHAWK-WIFI-DDR4/Overview) vs [ASRock B660 Steel Legend](https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/B660%20Steel%20Legend/index.asp#Specification)

I've been waiting for these budget mobos to release ever since my old MSI Z97 Gaming 5 mobo died about 3 weeks ago.  This mobo issue has caused me to finally upgrade some parts into a still modest, but more modern PC (see below).  However, I still haven't bought the actual part that prompted all of this in the first place - a mobo.  I'm trying to determine which one of these based on specs should be the one I go to.  I can get the MSI MAG B660 Tomahawk for $179.99 US now, or wait on ASRock B660 Steel Legend which will most likely be a little cheaper.  I do want ATX form factor though so that it fits nicely in my case.

I've been out of the PC game for a long time now (as you can tell from my old PC specs), but I want to get something that will last and give me option to upgrade in the future.  I'm not an overclocker (but will try to boost RAM some).  I'm not sure I need all the ports on the MSI board, but if quality/BIOs support is generally better then that is definitely a factor. I know MSI had a great reputation years ago, not sure how they fair now.  Not very familiar with ASRock besides watching a youtube video showing that they false advertised B550 mobo capabilities or something and had bad VRMs that could impact CPU performance. 

Anyway, any opinions from those more knowledgeable than me are welcome.  I essentially want to make the decision ASAP (even if Steel Legend isn't out yet).

buildapc,"Random shutdowns with no BSOD, error logs or codes, or any warning","Hi, I struggled to figure where to post this since, well I'm not building a PC, but I know that most people here are smarter than me so it's worth a shot.

Specs :

EVGA GTX 1060 3gb

Ryzen 5 2600

16gb of Corsair Vengeance 3200mhz (2x8)

ASUS Prime B-450 Plus

650W Cooler Master PSU 80+ Gold rated

500gb NVME Samsung 970 Evo Plus (OS Drive)

3tb WD drive (I don't know the specifics its an old drive)

Windows 11

For the past month or so, my pc (built in 2018) has randomly shutdown with zero warning and no error message/code/log, and no BSOD. It is random but can be recreated. I suspect it may possibly be a VRAM issue of some sort because I can recreate the shutdown by opening different games that max the VRAM, notably deathloop, if I open deathloop it goes to the menu and checking task manager the VRAM spikes to nearly 3gb of usage, then shortly after the whole system shuts down exactly like the random shutdowns. This happens in other games randomly as well, KSP launches, and I may play it for 2 hours then it will unexpectedly shutdown. Minecraft showed similar results as KSP. 

I wouldn't be so confused or stumped if it just happened playing games (I would still be somewhat confused but probably be more dismissive because it was likely me running out of VRAM) but it also happens extremely randomly with 0 patterns. One time I opened Ableton Live 11, and around 10 minutes in everything shutdown. Another time I had turned on my pc, not even logged in, and left to grab a drink. When I came back the PC had shutdown. It even happened before windows had booted, I pressed the power button, and then before the loading screen came on, it shutdown.

My wallpaper also bugs out frequently. It either A : turns black after showing the wallpaper for a few minutes, or B : if I drag my mouse with the selection box, it creates black spots in the shape and size of the selection box.

I so far have only run memory tests, which showed no errors. I checked the windows logs, and whenever it shutdown, the only ""error"" was an unexpected shutdown event. I've reinstalled windows already and the problem persisted.

I suspect it could probably also be the PSU, when I plug in a USB-C cable and into a specific wireless charger (it's only that specific brand/model, I have 2 and both cause the problem) it shuts down, but if I plug my Quest 2 into it, it doesn't shutdown. 

I am genuinely stumped as to what this issue could be."

I  have a habbit of running many programs at once and leaving many browser  tabs open at all times. Please dont suggest that I change my habits. I  bought more RAM so I wouldnt have to do that.

The PC can see that  there is 64gb of RAM, but it has set half of it as ""hardware reserved"".  I don't know what that means but I know that its only allowing me to  use the same 32GB that I had before, which is useless. I have already  updated to the latest BIOS, reset the CMOS, and changed the Page File  for Virtual Memory. If there is a way to fix this please help.

If  there is not a way to fix this, please tell me what motherboard I can  buy and plug everything into it and it will just work without me having  to do any fuckery."

buildapc,Building a pc - is it true that 12th gen intels cant run many games?,"Hey guys,

I am currently putting together a super high end new PC build that's gonna be used for gaming, streaming, etc. I want it to run as smoothly and as best as it can, so no budget limit really.   
Originally the cpu core was gonna be an i7 11700 gen, but then I found out I could upgrade it to a 12th gen instead of 11th, and now I have an i7 12700.

Though after discussing this with a few colleagues, one of them noted that because the 12th gen is quite new it won't be able to run many games. I tried researching about it and I'm getting 50-50 answers (it can run games! it cant run games!) so lol I've decided to transition over to reddit and see what you guys think.

I know the 12th gen is a lot more advanced and will (I hope, at least) run a LOT smoother than an 11th gen. But I don't want to get myself a higher generation intel if it means I won't be able to run many games (since that's why I'm getting a new PC in the first place...). I'm no computer geek, so help will be very much appreciated. What do you guys recommend? Will the 11th gen run games just fine? Or should I go for the 12th?

Btw, the sort of games I want to run are steam games like Destiny, Halo infinite, raft, valorant, splitgate, half life, minecraft, Fnaf security breach, phasmophobia and probably a lot more lmao.

Anyways, thanks for reading! Advice is much appreciated."

buildapc,"4 sticks of RAM won't always boot with XMP enabled, otherwise PC runs stable","PC specs:

* Gigabyte AORUS B550 PRO-P
* Ryzen 5 3600X
* 32GB HyperX Predator 3600MHz CL17 (4 x 8GB sticks)

&amp;#x200B;

Until recently I was running one kit of 2x8GB RAM, just selected 3600MHz XMP profile and it worked without any problems.

I bought one more kit of the exact same RAM and I've been getting a strange problem.

With XMP Profile 1 (3600MHz) selected:

1. First startup: PC boots up and runs stable, passes Memtest, Cinebench, gaming etc. 
2. Second startup: CPU fan goes 100% speed for \~10 seconds and then the PC boots up, runs stable
3. Third startup: CPU fan goes 100% speed and the PC doesn't post. 
4. **Holding down power off button shuts down the PC, next startup is like the first one, and the cycle repeats.**

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, the PC boots up 2 out of 3 times, but once up it runs completely stable with no issues.

I have tried increasing/decreasing the RAM and SOC voltage, tried manually entering the timings in UEFI from the screenshot below, set the FCLK etc. but nothing fixed the issue. I'm guessing something in the subtimings is preventing it from booting up every time.

buildapc,6800xt Crashing Unless I Raise Power Limit,"So I recently upgraded to a Powercolor Red Devil 6800xt from a GTX 1070 and a MSI MPG 850w power supply to pair with it. However, when gaming on this new setup I would start to notice bad flickering and then the computer reboots. Other times the game would just crash but no reboot. All of my temps were fine and the junction temp never got past 85 Celsius. I noticed my gpu would sometimes spike to 330w of power usage (stock settings).

I tried everything I could think of:

* DDU uninstalled all drivers in safe mode. 
* Ran a windows memory diagnostic and it reported errors with the RAM. So I purchased new RAM but still experienced flickering and rebooting. 
* I had a daisy chain PCIE cable plugged in - realized my mistake and ran two separate cables. I even thought plugging my system into a power strip may have hindered the GPU's high wattage power draw so I plugged into wall instead. 
* Bought new DP and HDMI cables.
* Reseated GPU and checked all cables were plugged in properly. 
* I got to the point where I did a fresh Windows 11 install. Nothing worked. 

Eventually I was fiddling with the AMD Radeon Software settings in hopes to undervolt and change fan settings for better temps. I raised the power limit and started gaming. I have yet to experience a single crash and my games are running smoother. I even overclocked the GPU max frequency to 2444MHz. 

**Why can I not run my card at default settings without experiencing crashing?**

Side note - the MSI MPG 850w psu manual suggests for gpus between 250w - 300w to run two separate cables. But for 300w + to run three cables (two on VGA1 and one on VGA2). However, my 6800xt only has two 8 pin connectors so it is not possible to use 3 pcie cables?

[https://imgur.com/a/AYft1dD](https://imgur.com/a/AYft1dD)

Current build:  
MSI Z490-A Pro  
G.Skill Tridentz 2x 16GB 4000mhz  
MSI Ventus 3070 8GB (3x Fans)

Corsair RM 850 80+Gold

Fans to work with:  
7x Deepcool 120mm   
4x Deepcool 140mm

A main benefit of the inverted case is that with the motherboard rotated, the GPU fans should help move air more efficiently.

My main questions:  
\-Front intake allows for 3x 120mm or 2x 140mm, which is better?  
\-Same question for back as exhaust, but I'd like to put my AIO here with 3x 120mm  
\-If I do place my AIO in the back as an exhaust would it be beneficial to set it up with 6 fans as a push/pull setup?  
\-This case also allows for 1x 120mm on the top, should this be an exhaust or intake.

  
While I do not have this case yet my first try at the fan setup was going to be

Front: 2x 140mm as intake  
Back: AIO with 3x 120mm as exhaust(I'm unsure how beneficial 6 fans would truly be)  
Top: 1x 120mm as exhaust (I've also considered using no fan on top to try and keep the case within  positive air pressure."

buildapc,is it safe to plug in my 3 pin rgb cable from my cooler to the led header on my motherboard?,"i have a cooler master ml240l argb and it comes with two different rgb cables: one of them is a notched three pin labeled *asrock, asus, msi* while the other one is a non-notched three pin labeled *gigabyte.* the cooler came with its own controller and it works fine but i would like the ability to change the colors and the only possible way to do that is using rgb fusion. 

my first question is: which rgb cable should i use? (i have a gigabyte motherboard and currently the one labled *asrock, asus, msi* is plugged into the controller.) 

my second question is: which header do i plug the cable into? i have 3 pin and 4 pin led headers on my gigabyte z690 gaming x motherboard (D\_LED1, D\_LED2, LED\_C1, LED\_C2) am i even supposed to plug my argb cooler into a led header? my motherboard doesn't seem to have a rgb header.

maybe i'm supposed to plug it into a fan header? i have three unused fan headers.

i've heard that doing this wrong can fry motherboard due to different voltages so i just want to make sure which cable i use and if i can actually plug in the (a)rgb cables into led headers since i don't have rgb headers.

thanks"
buildapc,Motherboard decision: Gigabyte or MSI,"I'm at a crossroads with regards to my new system ([PCPP](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/mrkorb/saved/qxT4Mp)).  The **Gigabyte Z690 UD DDR4** has been out of stock ever since I can remember, while the **MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4** is almost always in stock.  I don't mind waiting at all, I am a very patient person and I wasn't planning on building the system until February anyways, but since I was finally able to buy my case at a decent price, now it feels like the time has come much sooner.

My current system does have a Gigabyte board in it (H270-Gaming 3), and while I like it, I can't help but be irked by what are apparently some shoddy RGB elements in it.  I have the RGB elements of my case (Phanteks Eclipse P400) connected to the board, and it seems as though the board cannot output a Red color signal at all to the case lights.  The RGB lights on the board itself seem to be divided over what can glow Red and what cannot, almost like the Red signal is being shorted out somewhere on the board.  This seems to be a purely cosmetic thing, and the system has never ever given me a BSOD in the 5 years I've had it, so I'm inclined not to let this be a reason why I should never buy from Gigabyte again, but it does make me question if I should go another way.

I've never built a system with an MSI board before, but I just can't shake this notion in my head that they are somehow a lesser brand.  Maybe that was true in the past and I just need to update my thinking, but I note the MSI board going for about $20 more than the Gigabyte and I have to wonder if there is really some added value to it.  In comparing the two boards, I'm really not seeing a lot of major differences.  MSI has an extra M2 slot at the cost of two PCI-e x1 slots and perhaps a better positioned pump fan header, but that's about it.  All Gigabyte can boast about is maybe that extra RGB header at the top of the board.  It's not really moving the needle in a big way either direction for me.

Am I overthinking this?  What would your choice be between the two?"

buildapc,First build for Games and Animation,"Hi everyone! This is my first time posting here but I wanted to potentially get some feedback on the build I'm planning. 

I plan to use this rig for art and gaming. Programs such as Harmony, Storyboard Pro, Adobe suit as well as some lighter Maya and Blender.

My budget is ideally around 2,500 CAD dollars or around 2,000 USD. 

Thank you for the help and time!

buildapc,Motherboard and CPU rec,Hey everyone! i have a question. For a GTX 1080 and core i5-8400 6 core what would a good motherboard be? Also i’d the i5-8400 good enough for a GTX 1080? Sorry if this isnt the right subreddit. If it’s not please let me know the right one! Thanks everyone :)
buildapc,Windows won’t detect my 2nd monitor,I finally finished my build and wanted to use my uncles old TV as a secondary monitor. I bought an HDMI to USB adapter and plugged it into my pc. When I go to display setting it just says we couldn’t find another display. Can anyone help? I’ve already restarted my computer and tried every HDMI
buildapc,Missing onboard audio drivers,"build:

ryzen 5800x

aorus b550 pro ac

rtx 3060

things I've already troubleshooted:

gigabyte audio drivers

ryzen drivers

realtek drivers

Issue:

my onboard audio drivers aren't popping up and don't work. I can get audio from Bluetooth through headphones and my echo, but if I plug in wired headphones (3 different sets, 2 different models) i get nothing. It does however pick up my mixer Xenyx Q1202USB for both playback and recording. Does anyone know how to fix this?

buildapc,I have an EVGA RTX 3060 TI queue space if anyone wants it,Ive got an email from EVGA saying that I can buy a 3060 ti at a very good price (can't remember exactly but it's less than 500usd) but I'm from UK and can't use it so if your from the us or Canada and you want it pm me and I'll give you my account.
buildapc,HDMI cable and DisplayPort cable,Do I need to include a DisplayPort cable from my monitor to my GPU if I already have an HDMI cable connecting the two? Do they work simultaneously or is it either/or?
buildapc,CPU and Motherboard pairing,"I need help choosing a CPU and Mobo. 

I haven't bought RAM yet but am planning on getting Corsair vengeance 3600mhz CL16 32gb.

I have a EVGA 3070Ti

EVGA cooler clc360 (evga sells mounting brackets for lga 1700 socket so I would be okay with a z690 Mobo if needed)

4000d airflow case

750w PSU

And a 1Tb SSD and 2Tb HD

As cheap as possible is great but I still want to be able to achieve 1440p while gaming, also would like the RAM to be able to hit the 3600 without trouble."
buildapc,What is the best PC I could build for $4000?,"I find myself in the rare position of having $4000 saved up and I've never actually built a PC before but I mess around with arduino chips and such. But ignoring case, keyboard, and mouse, what is the best setup I could build/buy"
buildapc,New Case for My New GPU,"Hello!

I recently just got the email from Nvidia letting me purchase a 3080ti Hybrid edition. Not sure if it was worth it but I guess we will see. Only problem is I have a NZXT 510 Elite case with a cpu aio. No room to mount my new gpu with its radiator so I will need to move my setup to a new case. Any suggestions for a case that will allow a CPU and GPU aio. Keep in mind both aio are 240mm. I tend to like smaller cases but look where that got me. I don't really have a budget. Pretty much whatever would be best for this. 

I have watched and read many youtube videos about cases and I know many would work. But it seems so complicated having two aios and some cases being mainly pressure. Some push/pull. Can't figure out what would be best for this case. 

Thanks for any input!"
buildapc,Gpu crashing,"So I I bought a gaming pc about a month ago from a local guy who says he builds them, and things have been going pretty well up until last night, I was playing D2R (I’ve been playing it on the pc not just starting) and graphics started getting choppy and within a minute it blue screened and then shut down. I let it sit for a minute then booted it back up, amd software popped up and said the gpu crashed but didn’t state a reason. Any ideas what would cause it?
Radeon Rx470 
I5 4590
Windows 10
Dell 3847 only 8gb Ram
I know it’s not the best stuff, probably not the greatest, but with settings turned down it has been running d2r, horizon 5, gtav and other games around 60-70 fps. Temps idle around 40c during gaming they reach up to 70c-75c. I’m just running Msi afterburner that controls the fan curve but sometimes it sounds like it’s on crack. I’m not super computer savvy, but can figure something out eventually lol."
buildapc,What is the best PC I could build for 4000,I'm in the rare situation where I have 4000 dollars somehow and I've never actually made a PC before. Any tips on what my setup should be?
buildapc,I give up my stand against scalpers. Need help to avoid getting scammed.,"I had a bit of a moment a week ago. This won't get better. By the time the 30 series stabilizes, the 40 series (or even 50 at this point) will be out and those will be scalped to high heaven. The new prices are the prices. 

So how do I avoid getting duped? I just want to purchase a normal unopened new GPU, I want to avoid a card that's been mining crypto and used as a space heater for the last 7 months and I want to avoid empty boxes and cards that come with built-in bends.

Where do I buy this stuff and how can I avoid scams?"
buildapc,Will I have bottleneck?,"Current system:

Ryzen 5 3600
16 GB Ram 3200 MHz 
3060ti
1440p 165hz

So currently i feel my CPU bottlenecks a bit on some games where i feel the CPU usage is higher than my GPU usage. If upgrade to 3080, will i see more bottleneck? And if I do see bottleneck, what CPU should i upgrade to to get rid of the bottleneck?"
buildapc,Please can someone tell me if this build makes sense?,"I’m trying to upgrade my gaming pc. Right now, the only new parts I’ve added are the gpu. Pcpartpicker really doesn’t tell me any real issues with using this type of build. I was hoping someone could tell me if this is a good idea or to use something other than a 2070. Or, if I needed to upgrade several parts to be able to use a 2070.

At the moment he'll be playing on 1080p60 but with a planned upgrade to 1440p144 in a year or so. I was looking at cheaper options with a lower end GPU but they all looked like bad value to me, so advice would be helpful.

buildapc,Windows stuttering,"I’ve wrote about about stuttering before but my system stability in whole is getting worse. I took my system to bestbuy to get it tested, they figured it was my 3080 so they ran their MRI tests on it. It passed every single test that were extremely tense on the gpu. In the end, I was told to just “break it in” since it’s still relatively new. Now whenever I use my system, I’m noticing stuttering just from moving the mouse on screen. I’m not really sure what to do at this point. I was thinking about getting an RMx psu and replacing my CXm one. Will that help and get rid of the stutter? At the very least I know my ram is not faulty."

Any suggestions? Should I change something?

buildapc,"First time building a PC, looking for help/advice","Title gets the gist across.  I'm hoping for some advice on where I'm at so far.  I hope these sorts of posts are allowed, I know some subreddits don't let you ask for general help.

My budget: $2500

Main use: Video games, primarily Borderlands 3, likely a lot Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, and watching streaming services (often at the same time that I'm playing video games)

I have a pair of Dell UltraSharp 27"" monitors (2560x1440 60Hz)

What I'm aiming for -&gt; I usually try to keep a PC for 4-6 years (I've been using MacBook Pros since forever).  So I typically try to get as close to top of the line when I get a new computer so that it will last longer into the future.

Here is what I've cobbled together so far:

CPU: i9-12900K (I want to be able to access video output in case I have GPU issue)

MOBO (I think that is the acronym for motherboard?): MSI PRO Z690-A WiFi DDR4 ProSeries Motherboard (ATX, 12th Gen Intel Core, LGA 1700 Socket, DDR4, PCIe 4, CFX, M.2 Slots, Wi-Fi 6E)

Memory: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3000 CL15 Memory

Storage: Samsung 980 1 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive

GPU: Sapphire Technology Pulse AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT

Cooler: Arctic LF II 360 or Cooler Master MasterAir MA624 Stealth 67 CFM CPU Cooler

I recognize the GPU is built more for 1080p, but the GPU prices out there are just astronomical.

OS: Windows 11 (suggested by intel for the CPU)

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't picked out a power supply or case yet.

I've spent some time watching Gamers Nexus, but I feel way out my depth watching those.

I appreciate any help you want to give!"

buildapc,is it worth it to get a good cpu cooler for a (sort of) budget cpu?,"Is investing $50 for a cpu cooler for a 12400 cpu (not officially announced, planning to get one) worth it?"
buildapc,Build review and CPU cooler advice,"I am attempting to pick the parts for my first pc build and am hoping to get advice on which CPU cooler I should use (plus a review of what I've already picked). 

I was able to purchase Asus GeForce RTX 3070 Ti 8 GB TUF GAMING OC Video Card, so that is the part I am starting from. The general use case is for gaming, video editing, coding, and potentially some streaming. I don't care about the aesthetics of pc. Hope I'm allowed to say that among this crowd :). I'm a little confused on if the case I've chosen should inform which cpu cooler I should be choosing or if it doesn't matter. 

I'm still researching the warning for ""The Asus ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING (WI-FI) ATX AM4 Motherboard supports the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 3.8 GHz 8-Core Processor with BIOS version 1004. If the motherboard is using an older BIOS version, upgrading the BIOS will be necessary to support the CPU."" and what this means for the build process. I'm assuming this means it won't fully utilize the cpu on first bootup and then I will have to update the bios on the motherboard? So if you have any clarification towards that warning, I'd appreciate it. 

Thanks!

buildapc,Lian Li Fans/RGB issue,"Hi guys, so I have a Lian Li Galahad 360 AIO I installed. It works great, but I want to run everything to my motherboard. The fans that come with it are SL's I believe. 

On top of that, I bought the Lian Li Unifans AL and both the the 24 pin, and the 3-8 pin Strimer Plus RGB extensions. 

My initial thought was that I should get a RGB/Fan hub to link everything together, but the plugins make for a difficult task and has driven me crazy. 

The SL fans come with both an ARGB and PWM cable for each fan. The PWM connects just fine, but the ARGB doesn't due to wings on the side of them. 

I also bought an ARGB cable kit that Lian Li sold for extra cables in case but that still doesn't seem to fix my issue. As mentioned, my end goal is to **run everything to the motherboard for RGB software control**. If anyone has more insight on this, it would be greatly appreciated!

buildapc,Rx 6600 - worth it over RX570,"So a local PC shop is selling an RX 6600 for around 700 bucks NZD.

I'm tempted to go nab one - I'm using an RX570 at the moment, with a Ryzen 2600 and a mixed set of 32 gigs of ram powered by an EVGA supernova 650 watt PSU (G2 from memory)

I game at 1080p, playing Dota 2, minecraft, eve online, OSRS, but whatever else tickles my fancy.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if it's worth dipping into my savings while they have a few left - I don't particularly like AMD (since I've got a long standing issue with the current setup black screening requiring hard power off... not sure if it's drivers, PSU or GPU)

buildapc,its my old PC worth upgrading or better to build from scratch? (specs in comment),"Hello, I was thinking of building a new PC from scratch, but was thinking if maybe is better to try to upgrade the current PC I have, besides itbeing like a cheaper option there is also the fact that I have never built a PC from scratch, and I sometimes worry that I might damage something while building it, specially the most fragile components like the cpu, or other stuff like that,other option was to just pay the computer store to assembly it

however I am still debating if maybe just upgrading my current PC is a better option, these are my current PC specs

CPU : Intel Core i5 4460 3.20GHz

RAM: 16,0GB Dual-Channel DDR3 798MHz

GPU: Asus 1023MB NVIDIA GeForce GT 520

motherboard: ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC. H81M-K (SOCKET 1150)

I dont know which exactly is my PSU, this is a previous thread I made where I showed a image of the PSU and was told it was around 240 watts

[https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/f29f7g/how\_can\_i\_know\_the\_watts\_of\_my\_psu/](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/f29f7g/how_can_i_know_the_watts_of_my_psu/)

as mentioned in that thread I was recommended to change the PSU if I wanted to upgrade to a better graphics card

also dont know what model the case is, its a older one with the PSU on the upside

so I wanted to know if maybe this current Pc is worth keeping and to just upgraded some components, especially things like the cpu

was thinking on upgrading the PSU and GPU, maybe adding another extra ssd (currently have a recent 1tb ssd and a older 300gb hhd that I plan on keeping both), but dont know if maybe it would be up to par to more incoming games, right now it struggles to games even from like 2015, also use my PC for 3d modelling and rendering

or just the fact of being old hardware, I remenber googling if the ddr3 ram stick could be used on a newer motherboard that use the ddr4 and read that it cant, and that the ddr3 are aprently old technology now, so was thinking if maybe building new from scratch to just not stay so behind since I obviously plan on upgrading it further

so that made me think if is better to just build a new PC from scratch, and them just add the ssd and hdd and maybe the dvd drive (dont know what other component from the old PC to add), or if I am recomeneded to upgrade allmost all parts them just best to make a whole new pc build

so what can be a best option? to upgrade this PC or build one from scratch?

also any recomendation to avoid damaging the components while building would be apreciated, dont know if maybe its better to make a separate thread for that

thanks in advance"

I have been away for December so I haven't started my PC for about a month until yesterday. I started it and tried to play the new GTA 5 update but my PC kept restarting as soon as I get in game. 

On reliability checker it said that desktop window manager stopped working a bunch of times. I tried to do all the solutions that I found online such as: running the scannow command on CMD which came back with nothing. Disabling automatic restart which didn't help. And a bunch of other solutions.

After a while I tried a clean windows 11 install (I had windows 11 before). This had the same issues. So my guess is that it is hardware related. 

Thoughout this time I could switch on and unlock the PC just fine. If I did nothing then the PC would never turn off. I also noticed that settings would crash when changing the display options. 

After a while I got fed up and decided to try switch to windows 10. After using another PC to make a media creation tool, I plugged it in and tried to install windows 10. 

I got to the point just after you finish installing windows just before you sign in to your account and select what features you want when my PC shut off and I cannot get the screen to turn on. 

When I try to turn it on the fan lights turn on as well as the keyboard lights but the mouse lights don't work and the screen doesn't work. I also can't turn the PC off with the power button after I try to turn it on. 

I need a solution to get my PC on and stop or resetting. Or I need to know what part I need to replace.

Edit: I also tried to launch the PC without the GPU using the Vega 8 graphics in the cpu but that didn't work."
buildapc,Power supply question,"Hello, can someone please help me with this? I am upgrading to i5 12400F with B660 ( is  ASUS TUF GAMING B660M-PLUS D4 (DDR4) a good one?), and have i5 7400 with 1070Ti.

Would the current 500W power supply I have be enough for that new CPU? One thing to note here is that im also upgrading from 2400 MHz to 3200 MHz (2x8GB), with a second SSD (I have 250GB, second will be 1TB)

buildapc,Windows Installation Media usb,"PC building noob here. 

So I just created an installation media USB to install Windows 10 from for when I build my PC, but I noticed the requirement was 8GB on Microsoft's website. Even though my USB stick is officially 8GB, it has slightly less than that amount. The media creation tool completed successfully, though. I'm assuming I'm good to go at this point?

What's stranger, though, is that if I look at the storage used for this, there's still 2 something GB free of the 7 GB available and whatnot. Is it supposed to be that way? Why the requirement for the 8GB?

buildapc,"What level of GPU can handle a large screen like a 55"" UHD?","Currently I have a 1070Ti, 16gb of memory, and a Xeon E2 8core CPU that I haven't been able to try with a large screen yet. Would this work, or would a large screen require more?

buildapc,New PC is extremely loud. The fans seem to ramp up pretty much immediately once it enters Windows,"Hey guys I'd really appreciate your help here. I'm a newbie when it comes to gaming PCs like these. 

*Processor: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 8-core 3.7 GHz (4.8 GHz Max Boost) CPU Processor
*Video Card: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 24GB GDDR6X (Brand may vary)
*Memory: 16GB DDR4 Gaming Memory 3200 MHz
*Primary Hard Drive: 1TB NVME SSD
*Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64-bit
*Case: Phanteks Qube Case, White
*AIO: 360mm AIO Cooler
*Fans: 9 x RGB Fans for Maximum Cooling Performance

I just got a brand new pc (Ryzen 9 5900X 3.7 GHZ, RTX 3090 24G, 1TB NVME SSD, and 16G DDR4). When I got it and removed the packaging and stuff (like after removing the glass), I hooked it up and tried to start it. However, there would be no display at all and the pc would seem to turn on, but after 30 seconds it would turn off and the process would repeat. 

I removed the 2nd stick of ram and tried again, and this time it booted to Windows set-up. It worked but the pc was very loud.

I put the 2nd stick of RAM back in and it worked fine, but the noise is still there. I tried altering the fan settings in the BIOS, as well as MSI Afterburner. Nothing. 

Then, I removed the GPU and though there was no display, I waited about 5 minutes. The PC stayed on and there was very minimal noise (as should be). I'm pretty sure it was in Windows.

Once I put the GPU back in, the loud noise returned. It sounds like a mini-jet engine whenever it gets into Windows lol. If I turn the PC off immediately and enter BIOS, I can see the temps starting to quickly come down. Also, it isn't nearly as loud once it settles down in BIOS.

Is the graphics card messed up? Or is it something completely different? I hope there's an easy fix!

Would really appreciate any help!"
buildapc,1060 to a 1660 Super? Or 1060 to a 3060ti/6700 XT,"Hi all,

I'm currently in a predicament. Given the current GPU market conditions, I've been thinking, would it be worth it to upgrade to a 1660 Super from a 1060? Or to be super quick and hope for the best and try to go for a 3060ti / 6700 XT instead?"
buildapc,USB header on mobo not working with Corsair RGB fans' Lighting node pro - causing overload and shutdown,"Hey guys, so I just installed some [new fans](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075VGN4M1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to help my temps and they use a Lighting node to connect and control the RGBs, and need to connect to a USB header on my mobo. When I plug the lighting node into my mobo and boot up my PC, i get the overload error that causes my computer to shut itself down after 15 seconds. 

My [mobo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HCVFCGK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) only has 2 usb headers and I'm already using 1 so I can't just swap to the other one. I noticed the cable from the Lighting node is a 9-pin and the USB header only has 4 pins (I've read this shouldn't matter although the actual cable i'm plugging in does have wires going into various other pins rather than just the row of 4). 

[https://imgur.com/Dl3wSvF](https://imgur.com/Dl3wSvF)

If I try plugging the cable upside down so the 5 open slots are connected to the 4 pins, my PC boots up just fine, but the corsaire software doesn't recognize my fans, so i dont think it's actually making any connection.

**So I've got a few questions...**

* If my USB header could be damaged somehow, is there some way to confirm it's definitely not working?
* Should I try to find some kind of adapter that will turn the 4pin USB header into a 9 pin?
* I don't want to have to replace my entire mobo just bc of one USB header, so can I use a splitter on the remaining header?

Any help is super appreciated, as it sucks to have these new fans but no control over the lighting, and they just cycle rgb constantly."

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:  


**Motherboard**

I would go with a H610 Board, but since the ASROCK B660 is only 20 Euros more expensive, I figured it might be more future proof.  
   
Are there any downsides to H610 that I might not be aware of? So far I see: no HD Raid setup (downside for me), CPUs can't be overclocked,  max. 64 GB RAM (two lanes single channel), limited PCIe slots (which I don't think I'll need), more limited USB ports (which I won't need).  
ASUS has so many different Models -K -A -E, is there any logic to their numbering system?  


**OS**  
A local Shop here sells Win 10 OEM keys on USB sticks. I wonder if there is any chance they are infected with Malware on a System level. Could I just download Windows from Microsoft as an ISO and then enter the key? Not sure how this is done in Windows Land atm.  


Any General Feedback? Obvious Pitfalls right now and when upgrading in the future?

PS:

Please don't tell me that I need to spent more money, I would... if I could right now (donations welcome lol)"
buildapc,3060 TI or 3070 for Three 1080p 144hrz Monitors?,"Ive decided to give in to the scalper pricing and just get something before my 970 that OC'd to the moon finally craps out.   
 

Would the **3060Ti** be enough to drive three 27in 1080 144hrz monitors  or should I just shoot for the **3070** and save my self the headache. I dont see to much more performance gain for the 3070ti to justify the price bump, especially scalper pricing.   


I mostly play FPS games on one monitor and when I do use all 3 its for Sim racing, mostly Assetto Corsa."
buildapc,Best possible AIO Placement in my case. I understand this is a common topic (Sorry),"So, I have a Lian Li Air Mini and put together my brand new PC, I also have the NZXT Kraken X53 (240mm) AIO. 

Anyone who is familiar with the 011 range will understand that this case has a side mount for rad/fans. Where is the best place to put my Radiator for my AIO to get best CPU performance? I currently have it side mounted with exhaust fans as well as two intake 140mm Fans in the front. Any suggestions?

Many thanks,
A worried new AIO User

PS, if you have any Q's then let me know incase I didn't explain in the best way :)"
buildapc,Where can I buy a prebuilt that won’t break down on me after a few months,"I was planning on building a pc like I did with my first but gpu prices just keep going up and I don’t wanna build a pc for some crazy price currently.

I’ve been looking at cyber power for a bit now but I keep seeing reviews on how peoples pc break and the support sucks

Ibuypower doesn’t have the customization that I would want

Nzxt is just nzxt parts

And there’s a few others I haven’t really looked at, what would be my best bet buying a prebuilt for around 1600-1800"
buildapc,Need help picking motherboard for high end $3000 pc.,"This pc will be primarily used for VR, mainly Pavlov and beatsaber. 

I plan on getting into game design which is why I went with 64gb of ram in this build for faster rendering speeds. 

I plan on doing a 4 or 5 monitor setup, should I get a second gpu? Could I just get a lower end gpu like an older 980 or something to power just the displays? I plan on having UE4, blender, a couple reference monitors and a single montior just for media like spotify/youtube/netflix for when im working. I plan on getting 4 75hz displays and 1 144hz display because I do want to play some other games on this pc at 144hz.

buildapc,Upgrading PC made windows unable to boot,"Hello everyone,  
I've recently upgraded my PC however its causing an absolute nightmare and I'm not sure what the root cause is. Every time I boot up, it gets past BIOS load, then immediately shuts down. I was able to boot into windows safe mode and the activation doesn't seem to be an issue. I've found that uninstalling the gpu fixes this problem until a new driver is automatically installed. Specs below:  


R7 5800x (new)  
GTX 1060 6gb (old - gpu shortage meant i couldnt upgrade yet)  
b550 Tomahawk (new)  
850w G+ rm850 (new)  
1tb SSD (old)  
16gb 3000hz Corsair Vengeance (old)  
Kraken x53 240mm watercooler (new)  


Im pretty sure I assembled it correctly, applying pea-sized thermal paste, attempted to re-seat the ram, checked SATA cables on the SSD, etc.

BIOS shows temps on CPU around 30 degrees celcius idle. Im leaning towards the GPU being the problem, but as you all know there is a big shortage and the CPU/MB doesn't have integrated graphics to see me through until i can get a new one.  


Any ideas on how to resolve this? Thank you."
buildapc,I'd love some input on my first mock up,"I had some help from discord that put me in the right direction and I put [this together](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/ZLcPmk) from a local store, the case is just a placeholder for now. I plan on using the 5700g for a few years potentially until I can upgrade to a dGPU, I might be able to squeak out a bit more from my budget but I'd prefer not to"
buildapc,Is there a way to uninstall audiodg.exe? Its constantly using like 60percent or more of my ram.,"When i go in to task manager and end process all my sound still works and my memory usuage goes down. I feel like if i keep using whatever this program is my ram will die.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 16 gb but if i need to get 16 more i will."
buildapc,11900k or 10850k,"Hi guys, which one is better for a gaming? I have Z490 Tomahawk board and both cpus at home for testing. So which one you would prefer? Thank you"
buildapc,Accidentally unplugged PC while running and now getting blank screen when turning PC on,"When i plugged my PC back in i got a BIOS screen once but after exiting bios I just get a blank screen with the motherboard VGA light on. 

I’ve tried some methods on the internet but no luck, anyone know what happened to my PC or any fixes? Thanks a lot"
buildapc,Custom PC,"Based on what you have heard or experienced, is computer alliance or BPC tech more reliable when organising a custom pc."
buildapc,Need help with 4th monitor,"My remote job requires looking at a ton of things at once and 3 screens isn’t cutting it. Im using the provided work laptop and have 2 additional monitors, when I plugged in the fourth one of the others stopped working. Im assuming the laptops gpu only supports 3 displays, is there any way to get around this?"
buildapc,Which one should I keep?,"Guys I have 11900k and 10850k at home, my priority is only gaming so which one should I keep and which one sell? Mobo is Z490 Tomahawk, both run perfectly fine. But I dont need two cpus at home.

Thank you."
buildapc,Humidifier,Is it safe to have a humidifier in the same room as my pc?
buildapc,Sound output being output through input,"Sound from YouTube videos, games, anything that comes through my headset, is played through my headset mic to all my friends in discord. It's not discord cause windows is showing the mic active. I've tried messing with sound settings and I can't figure it out for the life of me"
buildapc,Selling RX 580 and Upgrading,"I'm looking to upgrade my graphics card to a RX 6600 XT. I've had my RX 580 for about 3 1/2 years(bought for $200) and was only used to game; no issues with thermals or gaming. Currently I see that on ebay these cards are running for about $350-400+. The RX 6600 XTs I am looking for run about \~$650. Is this a worthwhile upgrade or should I wait till prices dip a bit more? My specs are below. Thanks guys

Specs:

Ryzen 5 2600 

32 gb ram 3000 mhz

rx 580 8 gb

144 hz monitor 1080p"
buildapc,3060ti vs 3070 vs 6700xt,"Cpu is 5800x. Monitor is 1080p 144hz, MIGHT upgrade to 1440p(main monitor only) in the future.
 
3060ti ≈ $760
3070 ≈ $870
6700xt (used) ≈ 840

For some more context:
• I only stream on discord lol
• I have 2 monitors - usually play netflix on the second one while I play on my main
• Usually play Apex/Valo but when I feel like it (once every 2 months maybe) I speedrun titanfall/rdr2/witcher
• I dont mind longer rendering times since I rarely do it anyway
• Coming from 1080ti"
buildapc,First build on a budget,"This won't be my primary machine. Its primary purpose will be online PC gaming with friends on low/medium settings at 1080p. Games include Halo Infinite, Final Fantasy XIV, GTA Online, and PC exclusives.

My budget is \~$1,000 (with the state of the GPU market in 2022, I had to make compromises elsewhere). I'd like to build something I can easily upgrade in the future. For instance, the GTX 1060 Turbo is just to last me until the dust settles on the chip shortage so hopefully I can upgrade in maybe 2 years?

I'll eventually set up a media server using this PC as well, at which point I will upgrade the storage.

I already have a monitor, mechanical keyboard, and Razer mouse, and I get a free Windows license through my University.

Is there anything about this build that you'd change? Any beginner's mistakes or oversights I've made? Rate my build!

buildapc,Building a Gaming pc around motherboard I got,"I recently came upon a solid motherboard (x470 aorus ultra gaming xm4 for a phenomenal price), and I was wondering what would be the recommended parts (RAM, CPU, GPU) that should accompany it, I have a good amount of budget (1000usd) nothing too crazy, just really need it for gaming since the gaming pc im using rn is nearing 6years. I have build gaming pcs before but im really outta touch with all these new pieces especially since ive never really went the amd route."
buildapc,Please help me to decide between 11900k and 12700k for rendering performance,"Hi


 I'm hesitating between

11900k/ GB Z590 Elite

 and:

12700K / GB Z690 Elite


11900k and 12700k are same exact price

Z590 price = 5500 LE

Z690 price = 10500 LE



I have those parts : Bitfinix Whisper 750 gold / Rx 470 8G

I'll use it for rendering mostly

What is your opinion? &amp; if you have any suggestions please?

Many thanks 😊"
buildapc,Urano VX 650W PSU,"I can’t seem to find info on this PSU, online, but would it work fine with a Ryzen 7 2700 and GTX 1060-6GB? Thanks."
buildapc,First Server PC Build: NAS + Plex + Minecraft Server,"I’m trying to put together my first home server build but it I can’t find a whole lot of references online for my specific use, so I’m hoping to get some recommendations here.

My goal is to build a pc from parts (either new or hopefully from what I have lying around) that I can use to simultaneously host a home NAS for my family, a small Minecraft server (maybe two), and a Plex media server.

My experience is exclusively with Windows, however I’m fully capable and willing to learn new systems. In fact I’d even say I’d prefer to go with something new if it means a better solution in the end. I’m willing to spend the time to learn.

For the NAS side:

* Based on what I’ve found online, I was planning to use Unraid
* I bought two 4TB WD Red Plus drives to run in RAID 1 for this. I expect to need more in the future.
* I want to be able to store my personal documents (photos, videos, any legal documents, etc) as well as the media files for the Plex server detailed below. Not sure if this will be a security issue for my personal documents but if I can make it work, I’ll try to figure it out.

For Minecraft:

* One small server, less than 6 concurrent players, Fabric MC with some light mods
* Potentially a more heavily modded, but still small population (also less than 6 player) Forge server
* If I’m running Unraid, was planning to look into MineOS Docker setup.

For Plex:

* I don’t expect more than 2 simultaneous streams at any time unless I offer to let 2 or 3 friends utilize the system as well. Would be nice.
* I have a 4k LG OLED tv that I would stream to. This would be the primary “user”. I (think) that would be a direct play situation as long as I have my files in the right format and packaged as .mp4
* Another TV in my house that may utilize the Plex server is 1080p and would go through a good ol Fire Stick. I expect some transcoding there. Unless that can be avoided by saving a 1080p and a 4k copy of my files?
* Again, if I use Unraid this would likely need to be another Docker application. Seems like I just need to make sure I have a supported CPU to allow for Docker + hardware-acceleration use. And Plex Pass.

Hardware I have on hand:

1. My old gaming desktop / current Minecraft server PC

&gt;CPU: i7 4790K  
&gt;  
&gt;RAM: 16GB DDR3 (4x4)  
&gt;  
&gt;MoBo: MSI Z97 Gaming 5  
&gt;  
&gt;GPU: GTX 980Ti  
&gt;  
&gt;PSU: 850W 80+ Gold  
&gt;  
&gt;Storage: 125GB SATA SSD + 1.5TB 7200RPM HDD

&amp;#x200B;

2. Spare PC parts (have recently been building a PC for a friend of mine and a PC for my fiancée, have some things left over)

&gt;CPU: Ryzen 2700X  
&gt;  
&gt;RAM: 16GB DDR4 (2x8)  
&gt;  
&gt;MoBo: ASUS ROG Strix X470-F Gaming  
&gt;  
&gt;GPU: RTX 2070Super (would need to buy, but definitely available through a connection, no you can’t have it!)  
&gt;  
&gt;Storage: 2x 4TB WD Red Plus (bought for this project), 2x 1TB Sabrent Rocket NVME (BNIB, bought on sale), 1x 2TB Seagate 7200RPM HDD  
&gt;  
&gt;CPU Cooler: AMD Wraith Stock Cooler, Noctua NH-U12S Redux (used for 3 days while I RMAd another cooler)

Other misc info for my home network:

* Router is Netgear Nighthawk X4S, Modem is Netgear Nighthawk CM 1200, Switch is Netgear Nightawk S8000. I like to keep it to one ecosystem….
* House does not have ethernet/network wiring. Was planning to do that myself eventually, and will likely run a cable to the living room TV if I get this project up and running.

First thing I want to figure out is what hardware to mix and match for this application. I’m open to buying new stuff (within reason, &lt;$1k) if it better fits my needs.

I’ve referenced this ([https://support.plex.tv/articles/201774043-what-kind-of-cpu-do-i-need-for-my-server/](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201774043-what-kind-of-cpu-do-i-need-for-my-server/)) Plex.com article and this ([https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/l9plkf/starter\_4k\_plex\_2021\_server\_buid/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/l9plkf/starter_4k_plex_2021_server_buid/)) other Reddit thread (among many others) to get an idea for what may work. But it looks like it can vary wildly if hardware acceleration is used… which I do plan to use.

* Will a 4790K + 980Ti suffice? Or would 2700X + 2070Super be better?
* Should I look into a newer Intel CPU to use QuickSync, like an i5 10400 with no GPU to save on power? Put this ([https://pcpartpicker.com/list/LrsgTJ](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/LrsgTJ)) together. I know some parts are overkill and can be cut back.
* I don’t think 16GB RAM will be enough to run NAS + Plex + Minecraft server. I do think 32GB will suffice to start. Thoughts?

I haven’t dug too deep into how exactly I’m going to go about setting up / configuring the system just yet past seeing recommendations for Unraid + Docker containers. If you have better suggestions, I’m all ears. But I understand that may be best reserved for its own thread. This one I’ll keep focused on hardware."

I am into competitive gaming, so need a build that runs 1080p around 200 FPS consistently on Call of Duty vanguard. I've decided to go for the 5600X + 3070 combo, however, my knowledge on the rest of the components is limited. Is there anything I should be aware of? e.g. overheating, poor wattage etc.? Would also like the option to overclock - is the RAM suitable for this?

I really appreciate your help!

buildapc,Is it even worth upgrading my GPU at this point?,"So basically I have been rocking my AMD HD 7950 3GB Vram since 2013 and it is still doing great. However my games are starting to look like PS2 games and I would like an upgrade. I was wondering if it is even worth it to upgrade to a RTX 3050 for example. Will it boost my performance by much? The 3050 only has 4 GBs of Vram, which is not much of an upgrade. Is it even comparable? Thanks."

The Kingston XMP Blu Red Series 8 GB (2 x 4 GB) DDR3-1600 CL9 Memory I was planning to move from a different PC to the one above. The parts are all already built and have been in place since Dec 2014. This RAM is leftover from the build I just upgraded and was trying to beef up the other PC until I could fully upgrade it as well.

I see a warning about Voltages and it scares me a bit, because I don't know much of anything about them.

buildapc,Amd 5600g?,"Hello, back in 2020 during quarantine I bought my first pc. It had an i7 2600k with a gtx 1060 6gb. Its a pretty decent system but I'm wanting something more and something that will last me a little bit longer.

I'm planning to build a new gaming pc in the up coming month, I was planning on buying the amd 5 3600 however the prices had been shooting up constantly and it doesn't seem to want to drop for a while. I've now changed my choice to the amd 5600g, with the gpu prices being up I planned to keep my 1060 until the prices lower and become more affordable. However from what I've seen online people seem to be super torn between loving and hating the 5600. I'm really not sure what to do atm and was hoping for some help. Is the 5600g a good choice? or should I wait for the 3600 prices to lower. I also wasn't sure if moving the SSD and two HDD from my current build into a new one would be a bad idea which is why no storage is on the part list.

I enjoy my games to look good, i usually play at medium to high setting with the rare exception of ultra. I play apex legends, red dead redemption 2, GTA 5 and plan on playing Dying Light 2 when it comes out.

buildapc,Rate my build! Tell me what I should change.,"This computer will be used for both work and gaming. Budget is $2000. Currently spec'd for high end CPU with intention of upgrading GPU in the future. I am not set on Nvidia and freesync but parts are based on what I saw available for 144MHz monitor. Open to switching to AMD and gsync monitor. No intention of OC CPU.

buildapc,Unsure what processor (and motherboard) to get for gaming &amp; streaming with a 3070,"Hi all! Like the title states, I'm unsure what processor to get. I've done some research but I'm overwhelmed with all the differences and respectable motherboards for those processors. So here I am, wondering what processor you guys think would fit best with a INNO3D RTX 3070 iCHILL X4 and what motherboard I should get with that processor. Note; I'm planning on buying a Corsair iCUE 4000X RGB case and a Corsair iCUE H100i so fanheaders is also that might get easily overlooked. It's been 7 years since I've built my last PC so I'm still a little out of it.

I'll mainly be playing FPS games but also the occassional weird games like Lawn Mowing simulator because... it's fun! Thank you in advance!"
buildapc,Memory Issue,"When my laptop is idle it always has a memory usage of 44% while charging (the fans are also loud) and a memory usage of 33% while unplugged.

Ive heard horror stories of peoples PCs getting fried from mixing and matching cables, so I was wondering if this still applies if your using the exact same brand."

buildapc,"Buying a prebuilt to grab the GPU, your thoughts?","Right now in my country RTX GPUs are virtually non existant for purchase except for a small number of very overpriced ones, so after being on the lookout for a long time i started thinking about buying a prebuilt to grab the gpu and put it into my own pc and put my old gpu into the prebuilt and resell it

So i have the option to buy a prebuilt pc for $1230 its specs are:

CPU: i5-11400 

GPU: RTX 3060 Ti LHR

RAM: 16GB (2x8) 2933 mhz

Storage: 512 GB M.2 NVMe SSD 

PSU: 500w 

Not sure what motherboard it is, all it says is this: Intel RKL H570 chipset

One problem with this is i have no idea what manufacturer these parts are from which is why at PSU all it says is 500w. My current gpu is an asus dual 6GB 1060 OC.

My thoughts are that after i switch the GPUs i should be able to resell it at around $930 and at the very least around $560

But before going ahead with this i need to hear someone elses opinion about this"

&amp;#x200B;

These are the [parts I picked](https://de.pcpartpicker.com/list/XjFMfP). 

as the title says, this is my 2nd build, I have a budget of about 1500€ and I plan to game casually. 

I want to play games like Witcher3, RDR2, Horizon zero dawn, and upcoming games of the same style at best possible quality, no esport games planned so far. 

Because I want to learn about it, I plan on dipping my feet into slight overclocking, but nothing crazy.

I plan on keeping this for at least 5 years, thoughts?"
buildapc,Alder Lake Cooler Compatibility?,I'm putting together a build on pcpartpicker that includes a 12600K as well as an EK 240 AIO. I'm getting a compatibility note at the bottom that says it may require a separate mounting adapter for LGA1700 boards. Is this the case or will most current AIOs work without needing new hardware?
buildapc,Best Pieces to buy right now and in the near future ?,"Hi guys, I live abroad and I own 2 computer right now. they are kinda similar, 960 gtx 4gb for both of them, intel Xeon 2014 and intel I5 5600k, 8gb ram dd4 and 32gb ddr4 and an old SSD. They can be used to play most of the games, I don't really care of ultra and 4k resolution but they are kinda old so I am going to replace some pieces starting with the 8gb ram.
I heard that is a good time to buy a new M2 SSD that should be worth the money but as everyone knows is still bad to buy a new GPU.

So my question is, which pieces would you buy today? Do you think that GPU prices will lower soon ? 

I have no problems with budget, I can spend even 3k for each PC but I can't stand overbuild or very inefficient quality/money ratio ( I am a bit autistic )

My goal would be to have 2 computers that allows me to play every game from today to the next 4-5 years.

Suggestions on what to buy and when ?"
buildapc,Will an RTX3090 TUF Gaming fit in an NZXT H500 case?,"Before you complain about airflow - yes I know. I bought this case before I got into PC hardware and would've chosen a different one. I have however modded the case for larger holes and put in noctua fans, and temps are fine. I am however worried about the length of the card if it's going to fit lol...

""Why not just buy a new case""

Well I just moved and have more costs than income for a little while (I'm 24).  My dad bought a PC for Machine Learning with Tensorflow with an RTX3090 for the video memory, but he decided to use cloud computing instead as his company is starting to integrate that into the workflow, so cloud computing was more streamlined for him. So he decided to give the PC to me as a graduation gift. Here's the specs for those who want to know, below. But my real question is whether that GPU will fit in my own case as [that included chassis is pretty meh](https://www.ipc.in-win.com/image/catalog/img/products/03.%20Pedestal%20_%20Tower/IW-PE052/IW-PE052_01.png?v=1589259351) and surprised that GPU didn't cook itself.

buildapc,CPU temp spike,I have a R7 5800x and I usually maintain 50-65c when playing. But when I’m loading into a game such as smite Ex:after picking my character once the timer hits 0 and starts loading us into the game my temps fly to around 70-75c for literally a split second and my computer makes a ding noise letting me know. Is that normal? Also happens sometimes when I play csgo loading into a game for a split second it will spike. Should I be worried because I know 90c is throttle zone and max I’ve seen it go is 80c.

buildapc,GPU trackers,Hey everyone. I’m looking to build a new gaming PC. It’s been a few years.  GPUs seem to be next to impossible to find still which is a bummer. I’m looking to get a 3080.   Can anyone recommend some discord servers to follow that can help notify me when stores have them in stock? Or a Twitter page to follow that does the same.  Much appreciated!
buildapc,LED 3-pin issue and 2nd Screen Question,"One of my friends are using an Aorus Z370 Ultra Motherboard and the led headers do not support 3 pin led lights. 

Is there any way for us to connect all of his 3 pin led lights or does he need to get new ones? He bought the Razer ARGB Hub to connect them all, but that also uses 3 pin to the motherboard.

Secondly, I bought a small 7"" touch screen to go with my new build. I am mostly going to use it for monitoring my cpu/glu temp, fps while gaming, etc. as well as be able to use it for video walkthroughs /discord while gaming, and (if I can get the touch screen to work) artwork/design.

My questions are, what is a good program to use for monitoring temps and fps?

Will I be able to actually use it as a touch screen or will it only be able to be used as a 2nd monitor? If so, how do I do that?

Thanks in advance for any info."

It has, gtx 3060, 5700g, 16gb 3200mhz, 1tb ssd 

I can get this one for around $1300 (not living in USA)

A new 3060 + 5700g is already more than $1200 here.

I've noticed in some games (such as Call of Duty) that I get some stuttering / frame dropping at 100+FPS, and I've gotten some advice that it's possible my CPU is bottlenecking my GPU. Thus the desire to upgrade my CPU.

My budget for upgrading is fairly flexible, but I'm trying to be efficient with the money I spend. I'm currently leaning towards getting an i7-12000K for CPU.

Upgrading my CPU will also require upgrading my motherboard. I'm looking for advice on the following two questions:

1. As I'm upgrading my motherboard (and have to choose one compatible with either DDR4 or DDR5), is it worth simultaneously upgrading my RAM to DDR5? How much bang for my buck will that give me? I would hate to upgrade my motherboard now to one that supports DDR4 only to decide soon that I should upgrade again to get one that supports DDR5.
2. The motherboards I'm primarily looking at are the Asus ROG STRIX Z690-A, the MSI MAG Z690 Tomahawk, and the MSI Pro Z690-A (in order of performance / price). What would be the primary benefits to getting the more expensive Asus motherboard? Is that worth the investment?

Any other advice related to my build (or how to best spend my money to upgrade CPU) is more than welcome! Thanks for your help :)"
buildapc,"New build advice, for flight sim","Hi all,

After having my existing rig for 7 years, which I built myself and upgraded along the way, I have plunged for a custom pc being built for me. 

A couple of things concern me though and I’m after some advice. 

In the new build I’ve elected to have an I9 12900F. I know the “F” essentially means no onboard graphics. Am I mad for selecting this option? I’ve never had need to use onboard graphics. 

Furthermore, for the first time I’ve gone for a 1TB M.2 drive and I’m having windows 11 installed on it. However I do have windows 11 already on an ssd. How easy is it to Mirror that drive onto the M.2? 

I’m hoping the 12900 plus a 3080Ti and 32gb of ram will improve my VR experience in flight simulator somewhat!"

buildapc,PSU gone boom,"I was playing Forza Horizon 5 and a weird whine started, thought it was some fan that started colliding with something so didn't mind it too much. Afterwards, a nasty burnt smell started to come out, the PSU did a loud ""pop"" sound and the computer shut off to never start again.

Of course it's a power supply issue, I had a 10 year old Thermaltake one on my system, but is there a possibility that it may have ruined any other component? It'd VERY sad if it ruined the GPU considering the current shortage..."

buildapc,Want to upgrade a prebuilt,"I have a $500 prebuilt that I’ve been using for a few years and now that I have some extra money I’m wondering if I should just build a new pc or just upgrade this one? I have previously upgraded the SSD and RAM. 

Here are the specs

NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050
AMD FX 6300 six core
Crucial 500 GB ssd
2 Crucial 8 GB RAM cards
BIOSTAR motherboard 

All the places I’ve looked online said the specs I have should get me minimum 60 fps on 1080p medium graphics but I can’t seem to get to 60 FPS on any games even with low graphics settings.

Has anyone had the same problem? Am I just missing something?"

I know that my build doesn't support 4-channel mode but as far as I understood 4 sticks should work like 2 pairs in 2-channel mode. Recently I bought another 2x8Gb sticks of the **exact same** RAM and installed them in slots #3 and #4, if I'm understanding what CPU-Z shows me correctly, these 2 new sticks work in 1-channel mode. I didn't configure anything in BIOS after installing additional RAM. Am I understanding CPU-Z info wrongly, or the way my mobo handles the RAM, or should I change some settings?

Until yesterday I used some cheap DDR5 module which was the only thing I could get my hands on while I waited for something more exciting. 

Now yesterday I got my first kit of  *G.Skill 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5 6000MHz CL36 Trident Z5 RGB Silver* and installed them to my motherboard, after a bios upgrade I was successful in running the XMP2 profile. Now today I got my second kit of the exact same G.Skill model, and tried XMP2 again. But it keeps crashing. 

I have tried the windows memorycheck thingy and it found no faults. 

Am I having these issues because they're from separate kits? Even though they're the same model?

90% certain I've managed to enable XMP on previous builds with same situation.

buildapc,Need a second opinion on my parts so I don't do anything stupid,"https://de.pcpartpicker.com/list/TMxjj2

So this is the first time I completly picked the parts for my PC myself and just out of pure stress to not mess anything up I wanted to have some more capable people tell me if it looks good and if there are any parts that I should replace, maybe because some parts are not much more expensive but give a much better performance (I live in germany if that has relevance to this). Also I am a bit unsure wether or not my case is big enough since pcpartpicker told me they do not know. 

I am aware that the liquid cooling is overkill but ever since I saw the LCD display in a video I kinda fell in love with it and this is the cheapest one I could find.

I want to use this computer for gaming and might want to get a Valve Index Vr headset in the future."

buildapc,GPU Recs?," I am in the process of building a new PC because my graphics card decided to die big time over the weekend (the set up is \~8yrs old). I have everything picked out except for the graphics card. I do understand that right now isn't the best time to be getting one since the prices are ridiculous or the cheaper ones are not in stock.

My friend that was helping me build the PC says I should try to get a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti or a 3070, but I know this is probably not gonna be in stock for a while plus I don't think I need something that crazy. For reference I am upgrading my PC from a GeForce 780 so all the games I currently play run perfectly fine on that and I don't plan on playing games in 4k.

So my question is should I just wait and try to get one of those graphics cards or is there a more readily available card that I could get that doesn't have a $1000 price tag? I would prefer to stay &lt;$600 for the GPU.

For reference this is the current build I have going: (some are parts that I am taking from my old set up to save some money will probably upgrade them later)

CPU- AMD Ryzen 5 5600 3.7 GHz 6-Core Processor

CPU Cooler- Corsair iCUE H100i ELITE CAPELLIX 75 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler

Motherboard- Asus ROG STRIX B550-A GAMING ATX AM4 motherboard

Memory- Corsiar Vengeance RGB Pro 16GB (2x8gb) DDR4-3200 CL Memory

Storage- Samsung 850 Pro series 128 GB 2.5 (SSD) Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5"" 7200RPM (HD) (Both from old set up)

buildapc,Help! I think my GPU broke!,"I was playing Apex Legends with a youtube video in the background when suddenly my monitor went black. Audio from the video in the background and the game audio died. 

My GPU is a Gigabyte GTX 1650 windforce.

I used 2 different hdmi cables and a displayport cable incase just one port broke. I used a different monitor and it didn't show anything. I can't get it to post.

I removed and reattached the cmos. I cleaned the computer and reseated the GPU.

Everytime I try to turn it on, the CPU fan spins and my RGB ram turns on but it isnt displaying anything to my monitor. I don't have integrated graphics and I don't have an extra gpu on hand.

What's my next course of action? Do I need to get the warranty card out? This thing's only a year old :("
buildapc,"I've been with AMD for a while, not sure I should continue or go the intel route","Not trying to troll or be offensive, just sharing my experience for a long while now.

&amp;#x200B;

My first custom PC (before working on my family PC from intel Pentium II to IV, to i5 750) was an i5 4440. Worked well for a long while, but I wanted to update, so I went the AMD route when Ryzen 1XXX arrived, with all the hype, always interested in AMD.

&amp;#x200B;

Got an (I believe it was called) ASUS Prime Plus B350 with a Ryzen 1600, and the issues started. When I decided to change the stock cooler, never could get the backplate to come off.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I stored it and went for an MSI X370 Krait Gaming. BIOS never saved the clock. Battery was OK, still changed it. Updated BIOS, still losing the clock time. Endured for a while, getting the alert at the beginning of every boot, until I decided to upgrade.

&amp;#x200B;

Got a Ryzen 2700 with an ASUS X470-F ROG Strix. Started having issues with power management, Windows 10 stuttering or completely freezing. Then, when I was doing a cleanup of the HW after 6 months (got lots of dust in my house), when disconnecting the USB3 header, the header came off (the plastic, the pins stayed on the board, luckily).

&amp;#x200B;

Donated the board to a friend of mine that had and old PC, and went intel again. Got a 9900K, invested a lot of money, specially in cooling that thing, and everything worked. Ryzen 3XXX arrived, and stopped myself from jumping again, until I found an opportunity to get a 3700 at a good sale price. Sold my 9900K that was working to a friend that needed an updated, and got an Asrock B550 Steel Legend, and the problems started again: USBs randomly not getting recognized, or not powering up during start up, front ports not working. Updated BIOS, ports that worked changed places with ports that didn't work. Also, BSODs.

&amp;#x200B;

Got a 5950x (I used to work with 2 or 3 VMs, so the extra cores came in handy). The USB problems didn't go away. Everything stayed the same. Donated the B550 Steel Legend to another friend, and went for a ASUS Dark Hero (X570). Updated BIOS. Still have some issues with the USB, though not as massive as they were with the Steel Legend, and currently have some issues in Windows 11, like stuttering or freezing. The things is, I'm also having some BSODs that are driving me insane.

Also, I have a 6900XT that every once in a while crashes.

Disclaimer:

\-I installed all the drivers everytime I got a new motherboard.

\-I did a clean install of Windows 10 (11 when it got stable) everytime I changed some massive piece of HW (GPU, CPU, MB).

\-I ran stress tests everytime I installed something to check temps and stability (though the only things OCed is the RAM currently, and before nothing was OCed)

\-Ended up removing firewall (Comodo) and antivirus, leaving everything to Microsoft.

\-Removed the little programs I had at startup, like Wallpaper Engine, to check if those were causing the issues. Using plain vanilla Windows 11 wallpaper (Windows 10 vanilla wallpaper before).

So, the thing is: I don't know if this is a common thing, if I have terrible luck, if this happens because AM4 has too long support, or what, but I'm on the edge now. I've spent too much money on this computer that has mutated for a long while between platforms, and everytime I'm on AMD, I have some form of issue, be it from the motherboard, or from the OS. Like I said, not wanting to sound like a troll, because I'm actually thinking of going 12th gen intel, but I feel like this has been too much.

&amp;#x200B;

I live on this computer, basically. I work, play games, study, listen to music, watch youtube and other media, program. I don't want this to be a pain in the ass anymore. I'm seriously tired. And maybe too much emotionally invested, because I enjoy working on my PC and I spent a lot of money over these, I don't know, 7 years?.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I stay with my current HW? Should I go 12th gen? I'm totally lost here.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking of getting an i7 12700K, an MSI Z690 Carbon WiFi DDR5, 16x2GB DDR5 Corsair 4800Mhz, and a Noctua NH-D15 chromax.black, but I'm afraid that won't solve my issues

I also tried looking at bios and still nothing (only shows the HDD, and the other 2 sata ports as empty).

I believe it is the data SATA cable that is not working, as when I have the optical drive in now, I can see a green light on the front and I can eject the disk.

Any tips? Are sata cables likely to come out / break, or could it be a different issue I am missing entirely?

First off wanna say I've posted  here before asking for help and tried everything people have suggested and still having the issue. I went and visited family and gave them an old pc I had which is just like an i5-3750k and an r9 380 4GB or something, with 16GB of DDR4 ram. that being said, that PC felt ""smoother"" in a sense when playing or doing stuff unless the system was under full load.
I came back home and my PC is noticeably sluggish and stutters when just browsing or opening stuff sometimes (opening a new tab might lag sometimes, typing into the windows search might take a second to show up, the search itself showing up after hitting the windows key might take a second, etc).
   

------
When playing games, I'll get the occasional stutter, temps are fine (under 65 for both CPU &amp; GPU), I noticed that usually the frametime spikes up, the FPS drops, and then the GPU usage will also drop accordingly. I think I upgraded from a 1700 to a 3800x and it helped but still had stutters.  I removed the AMD SATA drivers and that helped a bit, but then it came back (this was tracked from latencymon). I tried using a new PSU &amp; GPU and it still stuttered (so i returned them). The only thing I've really not tried was a new motherboard cause its a PITA. When trying to use the GPU Computer test from Passmark PerformanceTest the PC would reboot. So that leads me to believe its either GPU, PSU, or mobo and some sort of failure to give enough power?"

For my Wi-Fi adapter, I use the inbuilt one on my motherboard which is the ""Msi pro z690b-A Wi-Fi intel motherboard"".

I find this issue really annoying as it means that I just miss out on what my friends are saying in the discord call and means I have to ask them what I missed. In rocket league, it results in goals being scored whilst I'm disconnected which is super irritating as this is nothing to do with how I'm playing.

Asus H570-Plus

G.Skill 32gb (16x2) 3200mhz

Asus Strix 3080 10gb

EVGA 750W Supernova Gold

500GB Samsung M.2 NVME

1TB 860 EVO SSD

H100i Cooler

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so first off let me state. I've ran memtester to 800% (I've always suspected it could be a ram thing) with 0 errors. I've ran cinebench and got a 2022 score for my cpu on R15 (seems about right since im not overclocking). I've ran 3DMark and got a good score for my CPU and GPU (I believe 11540 for CPU and like 17500 for GPU). I run ALL of my games on SSD or NVME and I've tried moving them to my M.2 drive when I was experiencing this as well as just reinstalling. I've also reinstalled Windows.

I notice games like fortnite and New World doing this. Let me reiterate it is very intermittent but enough to trigger my OCD. Occasionally, I'll be moving around and turning or going in a new zone and feel a micro or nanosecond of a freeze. Again, I dont get this issue on games that arent open world like Phasmophobia, Valorant, etc. I've tried DX12 and DX11 on fortnite (I've heard Chapter 3 of Fortnite is very unoptimized and buggy because of UE5). DX11 is a stuttery mess and DX12 is much more playable but still ocassional hiccups. Again, I'm very OCD so maybe my issue is just that the two games im playing are badly optimized. 

The only thing that got my attention was that especially in fortnite ( and it could be coincidental) was that I changed my dram voltage to 1.38 volts and my VSA and VCCIO to 1.220 volts and 1.2 volts respectively and I noticed a reduction in stutters especially when initially loading into the map and turning and moving around. The ram stick i have has i believe 16-18-18-38 timings? and 1.35v which is being run in my bios as XMP. 

Thanks all

any response is appreciated"
buildapc,Nvme or older Sata ssd for windows,I recently just bought a prebuilt pc with a 1tb nvme drive in it. In my old pc I had a 250gb sata samsung ssd just for windows use alone. Should I install my windows on the nvme or reuse my old ssd for dedicated windows?

buildapc,Airflow in Case - Question about Fanorientation,"Hello all, 

I have a question about the airflow in my new PC. 

I have a Corsair D5000 airflow case and a AIO Liquid Cooler. Unfortunately I cant mount the radiator of the liquid cooler over my Mainboard. There is a metal cooling unit on the MSI B550 Gaming motherboard that makes it impossible to mount it on top. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have two fans on top of the PC (Silent Wings 3 140mm) and one at the back of the computer ( corsair fan that came with the case, 120mm) that blow air inside the case. The radiator on front of the PC blows the air out (3 fans, 120mm) 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your opinons on that set up, is the airflow setup in the case working? 

I dont want my system to run extremely hot because of bad airflow, I hope someone can help me!"

buildapc,5900x + 5700XT,"Evening all, 

I am looking to upgrade a little on my PC. I am thinking of getting a 5900x to upgrade from my I7 6700K (Yes I will be getting a new mobo). 

My question is will a 5900x make my 5700xt want to kill its self? I assume they are happily compatible but will I have any issues running games etc with my GPU dragging its feet? I will upgrade GPU once the prices start to not be so silly in this current climate. 

(Also I gather the 5900x is totally overkill for gaming but just looking to have something that will stand the test of time for a good while)

Many thanks for any help!"

buildapc,Which 12th gen Intel chip ? (Discussion),"First of all there are the Celerons (2 cores, 2 threads), and the Pentiums (2 cores, 4 threads). In most cases they won't be worth buying in that the performance is low enough that you'd just buy a used PC, or an older gen with cheaper motherboard costs.

The i3 has three models

* I3-12100f ($100), 4C, 8T, no GPU, 3.3/4.3 GHz. Will give good gaming performance with a discrete GPU
* I3-12100 ($125) ditto but with 24 EU GPU built-in that's the same as https://www.xda-developers.com/intel-core-i3-12300-vs-amd-ryzen-3-5300g/amp/ gen Intel, which was improved by about 40% from the 10th gen but still much worse than Ryzen, let alone a discrete GPU
* I3-12300 ($145) 3.5/4.4 GHz. $20 gets you an extra 100 MHz peak (2.4%), which is a pretty bad deal
* I5-12400f ($170). Now an i5, you get 18MB cache instead of 12MB and 6 cores rather than 4. This is worth the extra money even though clock speeds aren't improved
* I5-12400 ($195) 25 bucks gets you a working IGP that's the same as the cheaper ones
* I5-12500 ($205) another 200 MHz, or 4.4%, and also a slightly better GPU, that is 32:8 in terms of graphics cores rather than 24:8. This means the GPUs in the 12th gen are the same as the corresponding 11th gen except the clock speed has been bumped by 10%. The 32 EU is NOT 1/3 faster than the 24, because the 8 stays the same, but it's worth about 12.5% over the 12400. For $10 more you can't argue with the value of this chip.
* The i5-12600 ($225) has another 200 MHz CPU max, for $20 more. There's no more GPU bump available this one tends to come up against the i5-12600k on value. But it depends on actual real prices in the market.
* The i5-12600k ($295) is a different CPU in that it contains not 6 cores but 6 +4. The 4 are low speed cores, so you can use 6 for gaming, 4 for streaming, say. In addition, as a K chip, this CPU is unlocked for full overclocking. To do this will require a Z690 motherboard, but you can get extra performance on cheaper CPUs by unlocking power limits - the actual overclocking potential is less significant than the extra cores here. 
* The i5-12600kf is as ever $25 cheaper ($270)  than the 12600k, being missing the GPU.
* The i7 gets you 8 big cores and 4 little. There's no gaming performance improvement in most games. For specific tasks such as rendering, the extra 1/3 more cores is worth it.
* There is a basic price premium of the 12700 series over the 12600 series of $120, HOWEVER the 12700/12700f are merely locked versions of the 12700k/12700f saving you $70, whereas the $70 saved on the 12600/f over the 12600k/kf buys you a smaller chip with the little cores missing.
* The i9 chips are the same story as the i7s - locked and GPUless versions of the same thing. Here the only difference from the i7 is 5Mb more cache and 4 more little cores. The price premium is $150 over the i7 for the locked chip, which widens to $180 for unlocked. There is improved performance for specific threaded tasks such as rendering and compiling, but for those jobs the i7 adds more for less money relative to the i5 than the i9 does over the i5.

For me it's unfortunate that there's not a locked i5 with the 6+4 cores, for users not wanting to overclock. This does mean that the 12700f/12700 is an interesting upsell to the 12600kf/12600.

I note the current retail prices in my country (Indonesia):

1. 12100f $115 (4+0)
1. 12400f $195 (6+0)
2. 12600kf $300 (6+4)
3. 12700f $360 (8+4)
4. 12900f $575 (8+8)

There are obviously therefore 4 logical product types, and the step from i5k to i7 is the best value of all of them from a purely mathematical perspective, albeit YOUR workload might not benefit."
buildapc,3060 difference?,"hi,

buildapc,Some advice appreciated! Looking to upgrade my gpu real soon.,"Last week I finally made the decision to slowly upgrade my pc to something a little bit more powerful by today's standards. 

For the past 6 years or so, I was rocking a gtx 1060 6gb, i7 4790, Asus Z97-A, and a 2x8gb ram. And color me impressed, they were handling quite well the demand, but last year the new releases were putting quite the toll on them. So I figured 2022 is the year for me to upgrade (terrible year for that, I reckon).

Started by updrading to DDR4, about time! Got myself a really good deal with a Ryzen 5 5600x, a Asus b450m-gaming motherboard and a whole new pair of 8gb ram 3000mhz. Felt the difference with some games straight away, especially of those more CPU intesive! Overall very satisfied. 

But now for the tricky one...GPU. Prices are needless to say, absurd! Guess there's no such a thing as entry level card nowadays lol. But looking at my modest budget and a proper upgrade that could handle at least some years, I was aiming for either a RTX 3060/RTX 3060 TI or go team red (something I've never done for GPU's) and try my luck with a RX 6600 XT.

My question basically is, what do you guys think, considering I might wait possibly till half of 2022 to upgrade my GPU and praying that prices might lower a bit, what's the best cost-benefit gpu on the market, that could last at least 3 years+? 

Cheers!"
buildapc,PC for music production and some streaming/gaming in the future,"Hi there, I have been a Mac user for 25 years but feel that they are not up to the task of gaming and streaming as playing Untitled Goose Game caused my MBP to hover as the fans were spinning so much.

I write music on Ableton so am going to switch to PC as it can run this as well, plus I plan to stream composition sessions. Really, I’m looking for a sub £1000 desktop PC that can handle a medium workload for music production, plus has a graphics card that can handle some live streaming (Twitch/YouTube). I think 16-32gb RAM is good, plus at least 512gb SSD, with more storage for sound libraries but I’m happy to compromise speed if it saves money. Monitor doesn’t need to be massive and I have a mouse/keyboard.

Any info about what I should look at is greatly appreciated. Also, if you think I’m dreaming and I’ll need to spend more to get a decent machine, also let me know. Thanks everyone!"

buildapc,Is this PC good for a kid?,"So I was given the task to build a PC for my little cousin (7-8 years) for his birthday. I was given a budget of 700 USD.

The case will be purchased locally and it is estimated to cost 50-80 USD.

I personally rock 1440p and the 144hz to 240 hz difference is not as noticeable as 60 hz to 144 and my 1440p works perfect for graphics games and also works just as well in esports games should I just recommend him a 1440p especially cos hes got a 3060 ti?"

Now, my question is, should I buy a new GPU, or a processor, 2 sticks of RAM (8gb each) and a new motherboard. Now the answer might seem obvious to some, but my current specs are:

GT 710 2GB
FX 6300 6 Cores (relatively old)
10GB RAM (relatively old)
2 Hard Disks and a small sized Solid State Drive
A relatively old motherboard (AM3+)

I was thinking of buying a Ryzen 5 3600X, 16gb of RAM and around a $100 motherboard, but if I do that, I don't think Il'l play pretty much anything newer since Il'l extract a GT 710 from my current PC.

And if I bought only the GPU, even though they're extremely expensive, for the price of those 3 components, I would buy a GTX 1660Ti 6GB.
Any recommendations? Thanks!"

buildapc,Using PayPal Invoice for Buying PC parts,"Hey all, seeking some advice. With graphics cards being scalped at way above MSRP, any purchase will involve some pretty high sums. Paypal invoice seems like just an extra level of protection by asking people to just write what the item is and send it to the buyer, but I've had a couple of lets say.. not pleasant experiences with folks on r/harwareswap getting an attitude about it. Don't really understand what the issue is, unless I'm missing something.

buildapc,I already own the GPU and mobo...does the rest of this build make sense?,"**Quick background:** A couple years ago I stopped halfway through Witcher 3 because I couldn't get what I wanted out of my GTX 970. ""I'm gonna buy a new card, build a new computer and then pick back up!"" I optimistically mused.

Two years later, I was finally able to get my hands on a GPU and a mobo through one of the Newegg purchase raffles. Now I'm just looking to build up a box that'll honor these components.

* I am not particularly budget limited, but not trying to humiliate my bank account to min-max a build
* Current performance requirement benchmark is Witcher 3
* I originally thought it would be neat to build a white computer but kinda abandoned that when I couldn't find components that made sense (if I wanted RGB, I'd have been set)...some of the component choices in my build reflect that prior goal (e.g., memory)

**The build:** [**https://pcpartpicker.com/list/rP7GBc**](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/rP7GBc)

**My biggest questions are centered on:**

1. **The CPU.** I am pretty out of it with CPU updates in the last couple years. My buddy incorporated this in his build and I honestly haven't reviewed other options.
2. **The cooler.** Aside from ""does it fit in my case,"" are there any important considerations I may be missing here?
3. **GPU weight.** I hear this thing is a monster. Is there a simple way to support the card's weight?

Of course, if I missed something else, definitely open to advice!"

buildapc,Confusion finding a LGA1700 fan heatsink.,"Thank you for your time,

&amp;#x200B;

My PC is having some serious problems(I believe discharge surges going out of HDMI and damaging monitors, but the outlet, PSU, and GPU have been ruled out.) and it's time to swap out the (old)board. Which means swapping out the Ram, CPU, and Heatsink too.

Here's what I have coming:  
[https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16813162038?Item=N82E16813162038](https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16813162038?Item=N82E16813162038)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm finding that I don't actually understand ordering heatsinks. So, I need one that's LGA1700 compatible? And, they need special brackets to connect? And those brackets aren't usually included with the heatsink? They have to be ordered separately, but don't appear to be universal? Wanting to avoid water cooling, I just can't seem to find a decent heatsink where I know I'll have all I need.

Am I missing something here?"

I have an i5-4570 (non-k), 16gb ram, and a 970ssc. I'm gonna stick with the 970 for now since I'll never get a good GPU for the $400 in my budget, but figured I can upgrade on other areas for now to hold over until I get a new GPU later on.

I can get the R5 5600G and a B550 mobo for $320 in a microcenter bundle. 16gb of ram for $48. I have a new case and power supply already that I found good deals on. So I'm right at that $400 mark.

Someone talked about waiting for the next gen to come out in a month or two. Would that be for getting leyt prices on what I already am looking at, or to get the newer stuff for this same price (maybe)?

I think the 970ssc will definitely be the bottleneck, but I can put some new thermal paste on and get that running well enough for my 1080@60 I do for my games.

My concern is because our PCs are connected to a surge protector, they're fine. The powerline adapter has to be plugged into the mains, and connected to the PC via ethernet. Is there any danger that it can cause to the PC? I'm not an electrician and don't pretend to know anything about this, I'm just concerned that it can surge and damage something.   


I had an event yesterday where on both PCs, at the same time, the ethernet ports on the motherboard got error code 10.

I use this PC for graphic design, printing. So programs like illustrator, photoshop as well as some printing software for a couple of machines. Not sure if maybe I would need more RAM, or a better CPU?

Thank you for taking some time out of your day to help!"

buildapc,Z690 and Power Limits,"Hi.  
I was wondering if those who already run a Z690 board (or even other x600 boards) could check if the BIOS allows to set the power limit for the CPU.

My use case is a bit different, for I'll use a non-K cpu and have to limit the power draw (for example, no more than 80W). 

I'm mainly interested in the MSI z690-A for it's cheap and it has everything I need (lan, number of usbs, video outputs), but other 600 boards would do, with the proviso that they allow setting the power limit.

Would you kindly check? Thanks!"

I started it up, and everything went well. However, once I try to stress test my cpu with cpu-z, a strange electrical hizzing sound is coming from my PSU . I turned off the computer and the hissing sound still persisted which confirms the fact that it is indeed from the PSU. After a while, the sound calmed down, but when I put my ear near the PSU(computer still off, but PSU switch is still on), I can hear faint electrical buzzing sounds periodically (about every 5 seconds, it will make an electrical hiss sound). The sound disappeared however when I flicked the switch on the PSU.  I did some research online and learned that it is a common phenomenon called ""coil whine."" 

However, as far as I know, Seasonic is supposed to be a high quality psu manufacturer. Is coil whine common for Seasonic PSUs, especially the model I have? Can anyone who has the same model as mine share their experiences. Is this normal? Should I RMA it? (its going to be a huge hassle though...)"

buildapc,Do I need to purchase windows again?,"Hello!

I bought a desktop PC in 2020, and when booting it up the first time, if I remember correctly, I somehow transferred the data from my laptop (an Acer Nitro 5) to the new desktop using only the start-up process thing with a blue background that you get on a new computer.

Anyway, now I am looking to purchase a new motherboard for the CPU I just bought (my BIOS cannot be upgraded enough as my mobo is OEM). I see it's a long process but I am now wondering whether windows will transfer between my old and my new motherboard. My current motherboard is a Lenovo OEM motherboard with barely any information about it online. Using the command prompt I can also see that my Windows 10 is OEM. Does this mean I will need to purchase Windows 10 again when I get my new motherboard? And what will that process look like?

buildapc,Is there any difference in the Nvidia branded GPUs vs others?,"The way I understand it, Nvidia is like Google/Android - The center of the entire thing. Then you've got Samsung, BLU, LG, etc. that are basically producing the same thing, but with their brand name on it. Is that what's going on here with the ASUS, MSI, and EVGA cards? (just to name a few).

I've put an EVGA RTX 3060 12GB in my first build I just finished. Is it really any different than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060? Am I missing out on anything? Would I want to be more selective when(if) I upgrade or build another PC? The card performs wonderfully and I've heard great things about EVGA as a company, so I'm just curious why anyone would have a brand preference other than aesthetics, maybe? I have noticed that the Nvidia 3060 looks waaaay nicer than my EVGA.

Just curious."

I sent the CPU and Motherboard back yesterday and got new RAM. Should I get a new PSU just to be sure? What do you think could have caused this?

Little bit of backstory. I built the PC on monday with all new parts. It turned on just fine and I was installing Windows. As I was doing a Windows Update I got a BSOD that was seemingly driver related. I didn't install any drivers yet because I read you should fully update Windows first.

buildapc,Main pc died but I'd like to use the SSD with the OS in it in another pc while I wait for the main to get fixed,"So as the title says, my main pc, an R5 5600X in a B550 A Pro mobo, with Win10 on a 970 evo, has suddenly died on me. I suspect its the mobo or the cpu, but it will take a while to get that checked &amp; replaced.

anyway, I pulled out the GPU which thankfully is still functional, and installed it in my old rig I'm currently using, an I7 3770k in a Asus Sabertooth Z77 Mobo (yes its quite old)

but I'd also really like to use my ssd with its OS and all the files on it. 

since ot would be an a whole different platform (amd to intel) I assume that just pulling out the old rig's OS ssd and putting in the current one will not only not work but probably break a whole bunch of things. 

so my question is, would it be possible to somehow still convert the ssd from my current rig and use it as the primary OS ssd? or at the very least use it as a data extension without wiping it?

also, if it turns out the mobo is the issue in my current rig, could I simply replug everything (specifically my OS ssd) into the replacement mobo and have it work right away? or would I still have to wipe the drive and perfom a whole reinstall and everything?"

buildapc,Mic in headphones will not appear as input device for mic settings on Windows 10,"I built my first PC a few days ago and everything is working great except my audio. My headphones work in the front headphone jack, but Windows will not recognize my headphone mic as a device for audio input. I have an AMD motherboard. There is a mic jack on my front panel, but before I consider a mic, I’d like to know if there are any options I haven’t exhausted. 
What I’ve done to resolve the issue: 
-Install AMD audio driver
-Adjust mic settings in device manager, sound settings, and control panel. 
-Buy a Bluetooth adapter (as my headphones are Bluetooth capable). This time the mic worked, but the sound coming through my headphones was painfully robotic and choppy, unbearable. 
-update headphone software, as there was a bug fix for Windows 10 connectivity. 

Would getting a splitter work? I don’t want to have to buy a mic unless I really need to, but was there anything I missed? Or perhaps someone who had a similar issue and resolved it? Thank you"

buildapc,PC won't boot with dual memory after motherboard change,"I had to change my motherboard for some unfortunate reasons, and after installing everything I noticed that the PC won't POST (idk if I'm using the right term, but it doesnt even reach the BIOS screen) if I have 2 memory sticks in (A2 and B2).  I have tried the other sittings as well and it's always the same. Both sticks work on their own if I put them in either A1 or A2, but still no POST when in B1 or B2. Also the PC boots if it's 2 sticks in A1 and A2.

So I assume the RAMs are not the problem, and I just hope it's not a faulty motherboard.

For the specs:

Mobo: Asus TUF GAMING B450 PLUS II

CPU: Ryzen 5 3600

RAM: HyperX 16GB Fury DDR4 3200MHz CL16 KIT HX432C16FB3K2/16

It would cost me about $400 (including new mobo). Currently, GPU's are scarce as hell, but even if you do find one they're incredibly overpriced. Not sure I could even find something with $400 even if it wasn't sold out, so I'm possibly just going to wait until later this year or next year for a new GPU. That said; 

Would I see any kind of FPS increase with the new system? Or would it just be money down the drain for little to no benefit?"
buildapc,I5 12600K vs Ryzen 5 5600X (Only for Gaming),Hi I need some advice. Which Cpu is the better deal for just gaming only with my 3060ti?
buildapc,xfx rx 580 8gb,Decided to build a gaming PC this year but haven’t been able to as GPU prices have been crazy recently though a buddy of mine was able to upgrade his and is offering me his xfx rx 580 8gb for $200 is this a good deal? And what kinda performance can I expect out of it
buildapc,MSI MAG B550m Bazooka or MSI X470 gaming M7 AC?,"The B550m is new and the x470 is used for about 15% more

Also, how safe is a used mobo? I always thought it is ok, but the seller told me his PC stayed mostly, which from what I know is not optimal for eletrocnics, is they correct?

I'm not a huge overclocker, but in my now dead x470 ultra gaming I undervolted my Ryzen 3600, maintaining it at 4200 at load and overclocked my ram from 3000 to 3200mhz, safe timings

The B550m vrm looks modest, will I have to worry about it if I buy it?
Question is, which should I get? Will I be able to do all that on the b550m and also upgrade it to a 5800x without worry in the future?

PC use is mostly gaming and occasional video editing stuff"
buildapc,current motherboard B 450 F Gaming current cpu ryzen 5 2600 // upgrading to ryzen 5900x,"The thing will not boot with the 5900x and at the moment I'm assuming DOA I work in IT for a decade or so and tend to be decent with this crap but I'm at my wits end  
Things I've tried:  
making sure motherboard still working and PSU

reseating cmos with PSU unplugged for a couple minutes  


Making sure that the motherboard is updated which it is to the most recent update (which I have a theory which the motherboard update could be bugged to not recognize 5900x)

all of my old stuff still works when re-connecting them so its something with the processor or the way that it interacts with the motherboard.  


Please let me know if you have any ideas or thoughts or support my theories."
buildapc,Questions about SSD heatsink,"I'm considering getting a Samsung 980 Pro 2TB.  I see it comes with an optional heatsink for about $50. 2 questions.

Thanks"
buildapc,Upgrading existing to power 4k IPS,"I have a 2015 setup with quad core Intel e8400 3.1Ghz, H90+ mobo, 8GB DDR3, Corsair TX 650w 80+gold, 1660 ti GPU, and various SSDs and HDDs. The card was more recent and luckily will see me through current shortage phase. As far as I can see the CPU and RAM are the bottlenecks. Thinking of getting new parts at the same as getting a 27"" 4k monitor (e.g. Ultrasharp or Thinkvision or some other IPS screen with excellent colour accuracy).

I won't be gaming at 4k. I will only need it for office work, and will just game at 1080p or swap to an old TN LCD with 2ms response at similar res.

I am thinking of swapping in the following (and in a new case, old one is 2009).
i5 12500 (not overclockable) with B660 board, 32 GB RAM DDR4 3600 Mhz, and keeping the rest.

Does this seem good? Is it worth upgrading non-GPU parts now or are prices overinflated? I am based in Europe (Ireland)."
buildapc,RTX 3080 with Ryzen 3600 gaming on 1080p,"I have the opportunity to get a 3080 from a friend, but I was worried about bottlenecking after reading threads on it.  I am currently running a 5700xt, and I know the 3080 is definitely better than it.  Will I even see that much performance gain from switching?  The obvious choice is to get a CPU upgrade but I don't have the money to get GPU and a new CPU."
buildapc,Can a cut of power affect my pc?,"To clarify, i said ""cut of power"" because the circuit only cut in one part of my house, which was just my room, it wasn't a full power outage. I simply just went to my circuit breaker and turned the power back on  


**But does a loss of power in this case have the potential to cause a power surge?** or should my pc be fine? When my power was cut, everything shut down (monitor, router, even my peripherals) but my pc took like a extra 2-3 seconds to shut down like it would if I manually shut it down, but my computer did turn on normally, and it has a 1000w 80 plus gold psu."
buildapc,"Just finished pc build and some case fans not working. Advice appreciated, I probably missed some basic step as this is my first time building my own pc.","Just finished my build and booted it up to see if everything was working. I installed two extra case fans in addition to the two fans my case came with. My CPU fan and the two preinstalled fans are spinning, but the additional fans are not working and don't show up in the bios. I plugged them into the mother board's (asus tuf gaming x570 plus (wifi) atx) fan headers. is there something I missed? I've seen mentions of powering the fans but don't understand how that would work as they only have one connector which is already plugged into the mother board. Any thoughts appreciated."

buildapc,BeQuiet! Silent Base 801/802 Top Radiator height/thickness clearance?,"Hi!

I've been looking for a new AIO cooler in preparation for an upcoming CPU upgrade, and I've been stuck on one important part. My obvious AIO choice is going to be an Arctic LFII 280 because it's a no brainer based on reviews, but one of the unique things about it is the radiator thickness: the radiator itself is 38.1mm thick, and ~70mm thick with the two fans installed. That's obviously a lot thicker than most AIOs and I don't know if it can actually fit in top mount(don't want to disrupt GPU airflow by installing in front). 

I tried doing my own measuring, but I got a full PC installed in the case already and my current air cooler is in the way of proper measurments. I'm afraid, based on my not-so-good measurments, that the fan blades would come in direct contact with the upper end of my RAM(HyperX Predator 2x8GB) sticks. Does anyone know what the official radiator **height** clearance of the Silent Base 801/802 case is at the top with an ATX Motherboard installed? BQ!'s website only writes the standard ""up to 360mm"" dimension, but does not mention any height. I've been trying to look it up for an hour now, but really can't find anything, not even a build with that AIO in this case, I'm honestly just lost, best I could find is a year old thread here asking a similar question :(

Any help is appreciated!"
buildapc,MY FIRST BUILD WORRIES!,"Hello wonderful PC Builders, I am looking to build my first PC, primarily for playing games (multiplayer mostly) and content consumption at high quality. I have a pretty generous budget for a first time build ranging from 1500-2000. I've had a look on pc part picker and their AMD Enthusiast Build looks ideal but a sort of friend of mine (weed dealer) says ryzen 5 has less than 8 cores/16 threads which is not desirable apparently. 

So my question is, can I maintain the build as is but buy a ryzen 7 processor instead of a ryzen 5? Or will this present me problems.

*PLEASE NOTE* I understand about 0.0000001% of all that stuff below, I have watched a few PC Build videos on LTT and stuff and the building part doesn't actually seem to daunting if you just play and pause a decent build video on YT whilst you are doing it making sure to triple and quadruple check before progressing with the next steps of the build. I also feel like I'm at risk of being one of those people that throw more money at something than I should, but I would also like to future proof this build as far as possible within budget. 

TLDR: Building 1st PC, 1500-2000 Budget, worried about swapping out Ryzen 5 for a Ryzen 7 processor and not being compatible with other components and how commonly this may occur with wanting to swap-out/upgrade any other parts.

buildapc,is my new to me 1070 dead?,"I bought a second 1070 non ti and it was working great for about 4 days, now I can't get the drivers to detect it. It shows up in device manager but says device is not working properly. It's outputting video just not being recognized by the drivers. My other 1070 is working great.

Iv only really tried restarting the pc cause I noticed right before having to leave for work, is it possible the driver just needs reinstalling? It can't be that easy can it? If it's still outputting video can the card still be  broken?

buildapc,"New build, need help!","Hey guys,

I’m looking to build another PC here soon, and I was hoping to use the Lian Li o11 Dynamic case to do it. 

Now, I would really love to do 2 GPUs in this PC (both 3070’s), but I don’t know how the logistics of that would work. I know that the Lian Li has the ability for a vertical GPU, but I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to fit both in it + have good enough airflow. 

Basically, my questions are can I fit 2 3070’s in this case? If so, what kind of cooling system would you recommend? Probably only going to be using 16 gb ram, ~850W PSU, and 11th or 12th gen intel processor (11700k or higher). Also, what kind of things would I need to purchase for the cooling system/vertical mount for GPU?

Thanks in advance, feel free to ask any questions."

buildapc,First Complete Build,"I dreaded this for so long and kept putting it off because I didn’t want to spend so much money, but also chance spending that money and breaking a component due to inexperience. Let me tell any of you people out there that are scared to build a PC, it’s really not that bad! Sure it can be anxious to handle the more sensitive parts but for the most part - It’s adult Legos!!

[Here's my parts list](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/BillQuentin/saved/#view=J4PmD3), and [Here's pics of the final build.](https://imgur.com/a/MSMfHeJ) I ended up not using the ARCTIC cooler as it was just a smidge too wide for my Mobo. The Z590 Pro Wifi has a heatsink above the CPU Socket and it was just too tight, so I'm using the stock cooler that came with my CPU until I find an aftermarket AIO. For the games I play, this thing is MAGIC. It hasn't stuttered ONCE at anything I've thrown at it, and I couldn't be happier.

Now I'm going to be sinking all my time and money into cable management, RGB, and an AIO. Thanks to everyone on here and on Discord who helped me when I had questions! :)"

buildapc,Almost done only cooler left!,"Hello everyone!  


I am nearly there in my first ever computer build!

Motherboard: Gigabyte x570 Aorus Elite  
CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X

SSD:  Samsung 980 PRO 1TB M.2 SSD

And now... I still need that cooler. I have been doing a lot of googling and watching many reviews only to be stuck still on which cooler would best suit my needs? I like pretty rgb so for a while I thought AIO would be awesome and then got scared at the leaking. I looked for air coolers but they all look really bad especially the famous Noctua one.... Noctua also looks huge and I am a noob I have no idea if the cooler will fit with my motherboard and ram... So in this desperation time I wanted to ask for some recommendations from you guys before I buy anything? Would you still get the noctua? maybe an AIO?"

buildapc,What’s happening to my pc?,"So I’ve been using this pc for now just a year. I bought it ore built because at the time it was cheaper to buy it like that than buy the parts separate. Over this year I put more ram in it and then an extra SSD. For Christmas I got a cpu cooler, SSD heat sink, extension wires, and ram Rgb covers, I got everything out tigether and turned it on and everything is fine and now after 2 weeks I’m playing apex and my screens turn black with no signal and a really loud fan turns on and I don’t know where it’s coming from because it sounds like a reallly loud leaf blower, and I can’t use the power button to turn the pc off so I turn off the pier supply in the back, this happened last night and just now this morning wtf is happening?"
buildapc,Disappointed after RTX 3060 upgrade - Bottleneck? Low Utilization? Low FPS?,"Hi Guys

I've just upgraded from the GTX1060 to the RTX3060 and also installed an additional 16gb RAM (Taking it to 32gb)... I'm not noticing any FPS gain, I'm using the same 1080p in-game settings as the 1060.

Previously when I was gaming on the GTX1060 with the i5-9600k, my CPU and GPU utilization would both be close to 100% in HWMonitor so it seemed they were pretty well balanced.

Now I'm testing the RTX3060 with the i5-9600k and the FPS seems about the same and my CPU usage is around 50% and my GPU usage is floating around 50%.

Please can anyone explain what is happening here? Am I being bottlenecked in some way? Why aren't my CPU and GPU working as hard as they can to achieve more FPS?

Tested on games such as Escape from Tarkov, Assassins Creed Odyssey, Total War Warhammer 2, Mount &amp; Blade 2 Bannerlord

RAM: I've enabled XMP and RAM is running at 3200MHz

TEMPS: Temps are good as far as I can tell with HWMonitor. CPU stays under 60°, GPU under 65°

PSU: Pure Power 11 500W 80+ Gold. I've connected the 8 pin and the 6 pin to the GPU and I'm assured by the internet that 500W is enough for this rig as long as I don't overclock

buildapc,"Another 40-series post. Are you in the ""hold"" camp, or the ""bite the bullet now"" one?","Friend and I were having a conversation about this yesterday as I was preparing to bite the bullet on a $1400 new-in-box FTW3 3080.  For reference, he and I both have a Strix 1080ti in our builds currently.

With the 40 series (supposedly) coming this year, even if late, does it make sense to hold out for that round of cards and pay inflated prices then as opposed to now, when the 30 series is on deck to be supplanted?

* My school of thought was this: ""I'm going to get gouged on a new card, so what's the point in waiting another year?  Especially given that I'm not sure anyone really knows when the 40 series will launch, and from there how long it will take for used (or flipped) stock to hit the market.""

* His school of thought was, essentially: ""I'm going to get gouged on a new card, so I might as well wait to get ultra-gouged on a 40-series once that launches because at least that way I'll max out my total performance improvement over my current card at the same (but potentially more) inflated cost over MSRP.""

I'm still on the fence, but to be honest, his thinking makes more sense to me in the long run.  If you're going to pay 40-75% over MSRP, wouldn't you want to wait until you can get whatever card will stretch that out over the longest possible time?  *I.e.*, a 40 series at ""flipped"" pricing once those launch?

I don't see the market getting any better in the next year or two, but that doesn't mean card performance will stall by any means.  Where are other people standing on this?"

Couldn’t really find any reliable reviews online.


Besides that, I also need a recommendation for a PSU, I have little to no knowledge about the specs besides needed wattage, so I’d like to get a recommendation if the [GA B700H](https://www.gigabyte.com/Power-Supply/B700H#kf) is good enough or I’ll need a better one.

If anything matters, I have a mATX motherboard right now, so it should have no problem fitting into the case.

* 1 rear 120mm fan.
* At the top, either 2 120mm fans or 2 140mm ones.

buildapc,Advice on broken front panel connector cable,"Hello folks!

I've ""recently"" got a decent deal on a custom-built PC with a Ryzen 7 5800X and an RTX 3080. It took several months from purchase to arrival -- but it arrived eventually.

After removing the inner packaging I noticed a loose cable. And checking more closely, I realized that this cable was not only loose but also broken ([Image 1](https://puu.sh/ICa9w/a5405eb8d4.png), [Image 2](https://puu.sh/ICa9G/60fb9a2a5e.png)). This cable seems to be connected to the front I/O.

I've directly contacted the support and after 2 weeks they finally responded asking me to create an RMA request. Naively, I was thinking they would just send me a replacement part that I could insert myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Because I really don't want to wait another two months, I'm now wondering if it would be possible to still do the replacement myself. I have been told that this cable, however, cannot be replaced on its own because it may be soldered onto the front panel or something. For the case I'm using ([Corsair 4000D AIRFLOW](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Cases/Mid-Tower-ATX-Cases/4000D-Airflow-Tempered-Glass-Mid-Tower-ATX-Case/p/CC-9011200-WW)), Corsair seems to be offering a [replacement I/O panel](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Accessories-%7C-Parts/iCUE-4000X-4000D-4000D-Airflow-I-O-Panel/p/CC-8900431). But I couldn't yet find a retailer offering this accessory.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you advice?

* RMA the whole thing?
* Ask the support directly if they can offer just this replacement I/O panel?
* Invest more time into finding a retailer offering the panel?"

Case: NZXT H1 case with built-in power supply and CPU cooler

**Information**

I have read the sidebar. I am building a PC that will be used 90% by my wife for home office but 10% by me for some PC games. I am okay with xbox-like performance, e.g. 30 fps 1080p medium graphics is fine by me. I would like to have moderate but stable performance. Low maintenance is a priority so I want to avoid things that will over-complicate the build or upkeep.

**Questions**


1) I was told yesterday that I should get high speed RAM since the integrated graphics will borrow from it. This motherboard says it will has XMP up to 5000+ mhz. That means when I set up my PC I want to turn on the XMP setting in the BIOS so that I can get the full 3600mhz speed out of my RAM which will be important for my APU set up, right? Is there anything I need to know about XMP? Are there risks? Is there anything with voltage I need to know to not fry my RAM or worse? I see flck and other similar acronyms and ratios but I'm hoping it is just as simple as turning on the XMP setting and that will get me where I need...is that correct?

2) I was initially going to go with the substantially cheaper ASRock b450 motherboard ($129 vs $209) but I read that there are BIOS issues. That if it doesn't ship with the latest BIOS compatible with my 5600G CPU then I would need to get an older CPU to flash (meaning update right?) the BIOS? I read the advantage of this more expensive Gigabyte board is that it has a physical flash button I can press when I plug in the USB so it doesn't matter if it comes incompatible with my CPU and I have no standalone GPU to access the BIOS, all I need is a USB flash drive. Am I more or less understanding the BIOS issues and why it is worth more money for the Gigabyte mobo? (I also read the Gigabyte mobo is more reliable with the XMP settings for the RAM which also makes it worthwhile? Does this seem true and worth the extra $80?)"

Reached out to the Acer support folks, and I was advised that only an M.2 SATA SSD is compatible with my unit. They've also given my a list of all supported brands and capacity of SSD for my unit ([https://imgur.com/wMitVT3](https://imgur.com/wMitVT3)) which I'm not sure if this is the only SSDs I should install.

Been wanting to install an SSD to transfer the OS and remove this minute of waiting for the unit to completely boot-up. Current HDD's disk usage also spikes to 100% even when doing simple tasks. 

Now my question is, will installing an SSD, even though it is only an M.2 SATA, still a good thing to pursue and will it improve the booting time? Or it will just be a waste of money as it seemed that M.2 SATA only has a Read/Write speed of up to 550/500 Mb/s. 

I'm also eyeing this one ([https://www.newegg.com/team-group-ms30-1tb/p/N82E16820331233](https://www.newegg.com/team-group-ms30-1tb/p/N82E16820331233)) but I'm not sure if this one is also compatible.

Hoping for any expert advise. Thank you so much."
buildapc,Need help with choosing a CPU upgrade,"Hi guys, I'm fairly new to the PC world and just need help with picking a new CPU that would match my current motherboard - as I'm looking to upgrade to a 3080 later in the year I would hopefully want a CPU that would be good for my current set up as well as after upgrading - don't really do much on the PC other than gaming and general use like YouTube, main games are F1 2021, rocket league, apex legends, GTA 

Here is my current hardware 

Motherboard - ASUS TUF Gaming B550-Plus (Wi-Fi) Gaming Motherboard
AMD Socket AM4 | AMD B550 Chipset

I had the opportunity to purchase a MOBO and Graphics card combo on Newegg yesterday and want to build a gaming system that could play FPS and AAA title games. I have watched a lot of videos on pc builds, but still am unsure of what components will work well together around my budget. Any tips or suggestions would be a huge help! Thank you! :)"
buildapc,"Could a faulty, near-death GPU kill my motherboard/CPU?","Over the past year, I've been having issues with my AMD RX 480 8GB that included:

- both DisplayPort slots failing, but both HDMI slots were fine so I continued to use those;
-  random, 2-3 second long black screens (as if video output from the GPU died suddenly) when my refresh rate was anywhere over 60 hz (I'd lowered my monitor RR from 144 hz to 120 hz to 60 hz, the black screening stopped at 60 hz);
- random driver crashes in any game that randomly stopped a few months ago;
- a driver crash 5 minutes into running Unigine Heaven last week in an attempt to stress test the card
- and a fan controller that over the past year would sometimes fail to spin the fans when under load causing the card to throttle under the high heat (funnily enough, I bought replacement fans the other day and they're , but I doubt I'll be able to use them now)

It seems to have all culminated in last night, when after starting Apex to play with some friends, I noticed intense stuttering, so I turned on HWmonitor to check temps and saw that it had reached 90degC, and as I was prepping to shut everything down, the screen turned to black and my PC restarted. After booting back up, the graphics card seemed to have not been recognized as monitor resolution returned to 1024x768 or something similar, and the AMD driver had disappeared from the system tray. 

I restarted again, and this time, no display showed at all. After turning everything off, unplugging the GPU and resetting the CMOS to use the integrated video in my i5 6500 instead, I turned it on expecting integrated video to work, but no display showed on that either. After turning it off a final time, expecting the issue to just be some form of electronic hiccup, the PC never booted again.

System specs are:

Intel i5 6500
MSI H110M Gaming motherboard
HyperX Fury 16gb (2x8gb) RAM (purchased in the last year)
Sapphire Nitro+ RX 480 8GB OC
650w Seasonic PSU
1 boot drive SSD, 1 storage SSD, 2 HDDs

I've attempted as many troubleshooting fixes as I know that apply to the situation, including borrowing a recently bought PSU from another build powering the motherboard in question, but no dice on getting it to boot. 

Does this mean the motherboard is fried? 
Did the GPU's overheating stint kill it in particular? 
Would the CPU and/or RAM be affected?
Can I install Windows on a new build using the same key? I'd be using the same drives I had.

I had a good 5 year run with my build, and I do kinda wanna know I did everything I could to fix it. Is there a way to test the motherboard specifically?"

With amazing help from the folks at r/buildapcforme, I landed [here](https://it.pcpartpicker.com/user/Elhessar/saved/#view=x98dbv).

Can you please check the build out for logical and/or technical mistakes?

**MONITOR**: I'd like to go for 4K 120Hz+, but the [Samsung G70A 28""](https://www.samsung.com/it/monitors/gaming/odyssey-g70a-28-inch-uhd---144hz-1ms-ls28ag700nuxen/) is still in preoder in Italy: should I wait for it to release next month at 749 euro? Any viable alternatives? I haven't found anything comparable for less than 1k in Italy.

buildapc,Meshify 2 Top Mounted Arctic Liquid ii 280mm,"https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/2kW7rr

The reason for upgrade or change is that the D15s is really chunky and fans can get loud. More so the chunky part when I need to get in and clean or dust. Now for my question.

I’ve been looking online and have been see very conflicting information on this but will the AL ii 280 fit top mounted on my Meshify 2? I’ve seen people say it fits fine but has little clearance between ram (high profile and low profile) to it can’t fit whatsoever. Anyone here with a Meshify 2 and a AL ii 280 or even a 240 one that can confirm if it’s fits fine or not?"
buildapc,"G27QC good monitor, bought second hand for almost half MSRP?","I have just finished my build. Hitting crazy FPS figured I've never seen before in my console life but am currently bottlenecking hard with a $60 monitor.

Is this still going to be a great monitor that I should jump on given its amazing price, or should I keep searching??"

buildapc,"I have a motherboard from the early days of M.2 implementation, I have questions about compatibility and practicality. If it supports PCIe 2.0 does that mean NVMe drives will work? 2242 is hard to find can I connect 2280 with an adapter? Will I get appreciably better performance over a SATA SSD?","So I have an ASUS Maximus VI extreme which launched circa 2013. As a result it basically barely sneaked in M.2 compatibility but its done through a proprietary adapter, the mPCIe Combo II. From what I understand this is a plug in adapter that supports PCIe 2.0 and SATA 6Gb/s.

So my questions are:

1. It specifies 2242 form factor M.2 but this is hard to find/expensive. **Could I buy 2280 and connect it through an adapter or cable?** Would this degrade performance or otherwise be inadvisable?

2. **If it supports PCIe 2.0 does that also mean it supports NVMe?** Sorry if this is a silly question but I've found that M.2 is just the port and can be used for NVMe or SATA. The manual never specifies support for NVMe and I'm not sure if support for PCIe 2.0 is the same thing or not.

3. **Given the above info is there any reason I could expect buying M.2 to not be worth it over just 2.5"" SSD?** Like if the compatible M.2 is more money than its worth or if it doesn't support NVMe and would be SATA anyway and the 2.5"" form factor would get better value for money.

4. Any other things to look for when buying M.2? If I can adapt it will any decent modern NVMe M.2 be compatible?"

On my old PC I loved Win11 but seeing a post a about a prebuilt Win11 license not being transferable, I'll buy a new one. 

I need TPM 2.0 and a CPU from or after Intel Coffee Lake right?

Aside from shortages...

Do most motherboards come with TPM 2.0 now or are they exceptionally hard to find?
That's really my biggest question.

Because I am paying for this, my dad doesn't know PC stuff, but his friend does.

Dad says ""My friend has it under control"" but I kinda think the dude who is gonna build the PC has not been told I will use Win11 and not 10.

I am paying so I need to make sure he orders a motherboard with a TPM 2.0 as I know nothing of motherboards. 

All I said was CPU from Coffee make or later.
And It was gonna be i7.

I told him what the PC should run at what settings, etc. and he can work from that in case some parts I wrote on his list made no sense.

I never said what Windows Version though. 

I will tell him win11.

But I really just need to know, are motherboards with TPM 2.0 Common or are they are? 

He says most motherboards has it nowadays but one of my friends was told that too by his own PC builder friend who ended up only having TPM 1.2.

Thanks for reading, hope I made sense."

1. Most importantly: Will I run into compatibility issues here?
2. Is there anything to watch  out for when shopping for cases? I don't care about looks or anything, just want everything to fit and I don't know what to look out for in the  speccs here

buildapc,6900XT Red Devil tripping 850W PSU,"Hi.  


A few days ago I decided to see how my rig would demolish PUBG at WQHD resolution, and to my demise It did not. Actually It didn't even make it past the loading screen, where it tripped my PSU.  


The max resolution I managed to run it at was FHD, where it did squeal a bit (coil whine is audible)  
, but then launched and I could actually switch back my resolution to native WQHD.  


There was some testing done where high end GPUs were spiking power consumption drastically, and 6900XT was known to do so up to 810W on its own. Source:  
 [AMD Radeon RX6900XT显卡功耗分析 – FCPOWERUP极电魔方](https://www.fcpowerup.com/amd-radeon-rx6900xt-power/) (Some graphs at the bottom of the article).  


Is there any way to limit power consumption? Currently returning this gpu for me isn't plausible.

buildapc,Pulled the trigger! Final bits of advice?,"Firstly thanks to this sub for being so helpful and sharing so much knowledge for new builders like me, especially in this chaotic market.

I've just pulled the trigger on all my parts and can't wait to start building, luckily i managed to get them all a good bit below their current prices just by waiting for discounts over the last couple of months. 

The GPU was stressful and time consuming. In the UK it's almost impossible to get a decent deal on a 3070 - I'd almost given in to just taking the hit for a 3070ti at around £900-1000 but managed to snag the Gaming Z Trio for £810 at CCL - I recommend putting notifications on for the PartAlert twitter bot, I saw an exdisplay Asus Dual 3070 for £650 for about 15 seconds once...:

&amp;#x200B;

.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to ask if anyone had any further recommendations - I'm not planning to do any overclocking beyond setting the XML profile but would it be worth adding a couple of fans? My case already comes with 2 but they're probably average at best. 

I'd considered a secondary SSD but wasn't sure if it was worth waiting until I'd need it. Are HDDs even worth it for anything under a couple of TBs. I've never filled up 1TB as I rotate games and don't use the PC for much to do with big files.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I need any specific tools for the build or will normal Phillips/crosshead screwdrivers be okay?

I'd also appreciate it if anyone would be willing to share their preferred guides to follow for building a PC!

For those interested I'm upgrading from an ancient workhorse running an A10-5800k, GTX 1050ti that's done me proud for a good 7 or so years! So needless to say I'm excited to join modern society :)"

buildapc,Zotac 3080 12G: Worth $1600,"Hi

I'm a new PC gamer, but (for various reasons: 4k gaming, MSFS in VR, future proofing) have been looking for an RTX 3080. I didn't want to pay scalper prices, and today I got lucky with the new RTX 3080 12G on Amazon (maybe because scalpers didn't have a link to set their bots on?): [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09PZM76MG/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09PZM76MG/)

It sold out soon after I scored one (pre-order), but it is waaay more than the RTX 3080 10G FE (at $700). TBH, I don't think I'd benefit from the extra 2G or improvements. On the other hand, I don't have a GPU right now (first build), and I'm relying on my Intel's integrated GPU for a little joy while I wait. And I haven't been able to get a 3080 in forever.

So I'm at a crossroads - do I keep it or give it away (at retail price - I have no interest in scalping). It seems way more than the 3080s FE, but then again I don't know if I will ever get my hands on one of those. Maybe Zotac is overpriced (I'm not familiar with the brand). Or is the extra $$$ is actually worth it - I'm hoping some reviews will come out over the next few days.

buildapc,PC Management Advice For A Beginner," 

Hello, peeps. I need some advice on completing the build properly and managing it properly.

This is my current Build :

CPU : Ryzen 7 3700x  
MOTHERBOARD : B550m Steel Legend  
RAM : Adata XPG Gammix D30 8GB 3200  
GPU : RX580 8GB  
CABINET : Coolmaster 300ql with 2 FANS  
ADDITIONAL FANS : Deepcool fc120  
AIO COOLER : Coolermaster Masterliquid 120mm AIO  
SSD : 120gb skhynix m.2 ssd  
HDD : 500gb hdd 7200rpm  
PSU : 750w Gold+ Fully modular psu (Silverstone)

The Changes i am thinking of making :

* Cabinet : Changing the cabinet as it's compact but it makes difficult to manage parts and put properly. I can't even fix all my fans inside this cabinet.
* AIO cooler : Currently i have wraith prism installed, should I switch to aio cooler or wraith prism in enough. I am not aiming for any oc'ing.
* Motherboard : I am thinking of exchanging it for a one that has Wi-Fi or Bluetooth even if it's a lower model than this.
* Storage : Adding another 120 or 240gb SSD. If I put 2 SSD's with two different iso's I can dual boot, right?

\# Handling PC Parts

* What should be a a good cleaning cycle?
* I get anxiety dealing with parts when I am assembling, that I might break them. What are the most delicate part inside the CPU that I should be aware of? Yesterday only I was trying to remove my sata cable with brute force until I realized there was a button that needs to be pushed for properly removing.

\# Software :

* What software do you generally keep on your pc's that should be on anyone's?
* Which anti-virus service to go for?"

buildapc,Bought a Ryzen 5800X to upgrade from Ryzen 3600 on a B550M board - How do I flash the BIOS?,"Motherboard is MSI B550M Mortar. I have installed the latest BIOS update to a formatted USB drive. 

Do I flash the BIOS while the Ryzen 3600 is still on the motherboard or do I install the 5800X and then flash?"
buildapc,Upgrading from 4790K,"I'm looking for an upgrade from 4790K, I've narrowed it down to two options:

Ryzen (600€):  
- 5600X,  
- Gigabyte B550I Aorus Pro AX,  
- 32GB DDR4 4000MHz

Intel (660€):  
- 12600K,  
- ASRock Z690M-ITX/AX,  
- 32GB DDR4 4000MHz

Price is pretty similar between these two (5600x is a bit more expensive, but Z690 boards are much pricier than B550).

I already have a case (Bitfenix Prodigy), GPU (RTX2080), storage and PSU (650W SuperFlower Golden Green HX). I also have a cooler, but I'm not sure if it's gonna be compatible with a new mobo, so I might have to get a new one.

Alternatively, I could get a new case (something like O11 Air Mini) and a cheaper ATX/mATX mobo, but I'm not sure about the temperatures in that one, apparently the GPU temps tend to be pretty bad in O11, and my current case gets great GPU temps.

buildapc,I have an RX 570 8gb and am thinking of trying to buy a 3050 on launch. Is it worth the effort?,"Mostly what the title says. I’m fairly new to building so go easy on me lol.

I bought a few items out of pocket, but am paying off the Ryzen 7 in installments, so Im trying to budget if I can. The 3050 seemed like a perfect budget part for my pc. But knowing the market, I likely don’t stand much of a chance getting one at msrp. Is it worth the effort of trying to get one? Or should I focus on a different card thats already out? Or third option, let all this blow over first? Thanks for any help guys! :)"

buildapc,PC won't POST after adding SSD,"Hello r/buildapc!  I have a 10 year old system with an ASRock Z68 Pro3-M, Sandy Bridge CPU, 16 GB memory, Radeon HD 7950, and a 128 GB SSD and 2 TB HDD.  I know it's old but it works for what I need.  Recently the HDD started dying so I bought a SanDisk 2 TB SSD to replace it.  Because the HDD is still working (just really slow), I wanted to keep both hooked up for awhile to make sure all files were transferred over before removing it.

The motherboard only has 2 SATA3 and 3 SATA2 ports, so I moved the HDD to one of the SATA2 ports.  I then plugged the SSD into the SATA3 port.  To my surprise after this simple change the PC won't POST at all (no beep, nothing on display).  I've tried clearing the CMOS jumper and unplugging all three drives and it hasn't helped.

I've been building PCs for a long time but definitely haven't touched this one in awhile, some things I'm thinking I could've done wrong:

1. Not sure if I bent the motherboard too much when plugging into the SATA2 port.  It's in the corner and has no screws right beneath that spot.
2. I didn't wear a strap but I never have in the past.  I attempted to discharge before touching the case and didn't feel anything.
3. I blew out some dust and used a feather duster on the bottom of the case.
4. When installing the SSD, I knew it'd be temporary before removing the HDD.  The SSD is in a 2.5"" to 3.5"" bracket but I didn't secure it to the case, so this bracket might've been touching the top of the HDD below it.

So I don't know what I did.  Hoping I didn't somehow destroy this motherboard from this simple task.  Anything else to try?  Thanks."

buildapc,concern about old HDD causing stuttering while gaming.,"Hi everyone. My hardrive is really old and bad. it spikes at 100% for many seconds just opening new tabs in windows 10. While i game i stutter while loading a new area. this was a problem for me before i had a graphics card and i assumed the hdd was the culprit. the spikes mainly happen when loading into a new area. But i think it could also be the ram being the issue. When i gaming it stays around 85% usage. i was wondering if an ssd will fix the stuttering issue. please help, specs are listed below :D

buildapc,Repurposing First Build For Emulation/Modern Gaming,"I have a frankensteined Dell Optiplex with a couple of components that are worth keeping. Two of them include a Samsung 970 EVO 1 TB for storage, and a GTX 1660 6 GB XC, and was curious if there are options to build something around these parts for $400-$600 to achieve a couple of different types of gaming. 

**Emulation -** Ability to run higher-end emulators such as CeMU, Yuzu, Citra, and Dolphin with upscaling. 

**Gaming Possibly Comparable to Xbox Series S -** I've considered buying a Series S as a dedicated gamepass machine, but with already owning the 1660, I'm curious if it's worth spending a little extra and if it would match or exceed performance of the Series S if paired with the right processor. I'm not really interested in 120 fps as I don't have a monitor for it, current one is an LG 4k 60hz monitor, but having 60 for most games or 30fps at 4k  would be awesome.  I also would be interested in getting into PC gaming in general and building a steam library.

Anyway, here's my partial part list so far, and any insight would be a huge help as I'm pretty lost getting back into this and prices being all over the place.

I'm open to different motherboards/RAM/Mid tier case that could help get the performance I'm looking for. I also live by a Microcenter, but have points with Amazon so that's also another top preferred vendor. Also open to buying used if there's any advice on what to look out for or what components might be cheaper that route."
buildapc,How to Troubleshoot Graphics Drivers/Card Crashes,I've just started having a problem where my NVIDIA 2060 graphics card/drivers seems to crash whenever I start a game. Is there a way to view/record logs to see what might be causing the crashes? What other steps could I take to try and fix this?
buildapc,"""The motherboard M.2 slot #1 requires an Intel Rocket Lake-based CPU. When an Intel Rocket Lake-based CPU is not used, the M.2 slot is disabled.""","I got this message on a pc builder site when I was trying to add a motherboard to my build specs. I don't really understand what it means so I don't know if I can ignore it.

buildapc,PC not turning on after GPU change,"My original GPU ([MSI GeForce GTX 1060 6GB](https://www.umart.com.au/product/msi-geforce-gtx-1060-gaming-x-6gb-video-card-35864)) just completely died the other day so I decided to get an upgrade to a new card ([MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ventus 2X 12GB](https://www.umart.com.au/product/msi-geforce-rtx-3060-ventus-2x-12g-oc-lhr-graphics-card-58489)). I've now installed it but my PC still won't turn on. I believe I've correctly installed the card and pins for power but still nothing. MSI suggests a PSU that can handle 550W. My PSU ([SilverStone StridePlus ST50F-PB 500W](https://www.umart.com.au/product/silverstone-strideplus-st50f-pb-500w-power-supply-bronze-modular-30445)) can only handle 500W. Does this 50W make that much of a difference that the computer won't even try and turn on?  


Note: I didn't diagnose the dead graphics card, I brought it into a shop and that's what they told me."
buildapc,do I need a bigger PSU,My PC part list on PCpartpicker says it takes 724W and is a 850 PSU good enough? I would like to over clock a little too
buildapc,Is it alright to touch the top of the GPU?,"Hi all,

Got a PC(prebuilt) for the first time in my life and it came today! I was excited to show it off to my brother so I opened the case and he touched the top of the GPU(GTX 3060), Ram(outside of it), and a cable with a P6 on it(outside of it) which has me worried( I know I am very paranoid). Never turned it on and his hands weren't greasy. I have no clue if it'll cause anything bad. Need someone wiser to ail my anxiety."
buildapc,Resources or Help With Installing Additional RAM.,"So I just got some more ram for my PC, it's currently running Trident Z 3200MHz CAS latency 16 2x8gb RAM on a X570 Auros Elite motherboard.

PSU: EVGA 700W

Case: NZXT H510

Keyboard: Corsair K95

Still having boot issues for nearly the past week and its driving me crazy. Sometimes it boots, other times it doesnt. I've tried narrowing down the problem by removing components inside and out and each time, the computer simply doesnt boot. Then when I put everything back together, sit there for a minute trying to figure out what the hell it could be, then press the power button it just randomly turns on.... but this is with everything inside and ONLY the PSU cable externally (no USB components). 

So far I've replaced the RAM, CMOS battery, and PSU. I've checked the thermal paste on the CPU and its fan and they look good. I really dont want to just give up as I'm really anxious to know what the problem is and neither do I trust local computer shops with my personal PC that I built. But I really dont want to trash anything as the parts are only a year old and they seem to be working fine.

buildapc,12400 and 12700,"Im torn between these two, current rig is i5 4690k and 970, main reason to upgrade is currently my main game, Black desert online runs horribly when playing youtube or live streams on my second monitor, cpu constantly pinned at 100%. Its acceptable when its running just the game but its not something im willing to compromise on. 

I know BDO optimisation is poor but i was hoping a new cpu could help. Ill be keeping my 970 since gpu market is pepega right now.

Also if anyone has insight as to how BDO favors core utilisation inregards to single core or multi core that would be helpful too. Thanks."
buildapc,Recommendations,"Hey guys I’m currently looking to buy a prebuilt gaming pc within the US. My budget is around $2,000. If you guys have any recommendations please link it to me. Thank you!"
buildapc,Need opinions on build,"Since upgrading my CPU would lead me down the rabbit hole of upgrading the motherboard, ram and so on, I've decided to put together a list for a new build. Have a 3060ti in my current pc (6600k, 16gb 2400mhz ram), but will replace with my old 3gb 1060 upon upgrading). I also plan on moving one of SSDs to the new computer instead of buying a new one.

buildapc,any problem using 750w psu with Ryzen 5 5600x &amp; 3060ti?,"as the title says, building a pc with Ryzen 5 5600x and 3060ti, i know 750 might be too much which is why i’m wondering if there will be any problems?"
buildapc,Which power supply should I pick? Seasonic core gold 650W or Seasonic focus gold 550W?,"Hello everyone. I need help choosing the right amount of wattage of PSU. I am choosing whether to buy the most recommended PSU (according to price range) in the community which is Seasonic Focus Gold Fully modular 550W for 4 909.58 PHP or go with the enough or rated B PSU, Seasonic core gold fully modular 650W for 4 705.2 PHP. My main issue is that I don't know if the 550W will be enough for my build because if it is enough, I will definitely go with Seasonic Focus. And if it is not, I'd rather go to Seasonic core which has 650W. My current build is:

CPU: Intel i5-10400F   
MOBO: Gigabyte H410m-H  
GPU: Palit gtx 1650 4GB  
RAM: 2x16 G.Skill trident Z neo DDR4 3600 MHz  
STORAGE:   
1x 250GB 860 EVO sata SSD  
1x 120GB WD Green sata SSD  
1x 1TB Seagate Barracuda Green  
FANS:   
3x ID-Cooling XF12025  RGB  
4x unknown brand fans RGB  
COOLER: Arctic Freezer 34 eSports (single fan)  


Peripherals:  
Rakk Ilis  
Logitech g304  
generic webcam  
Jabra Headset

If ever my question is hard to answer. Someone with 550W PSU can share his/her build, and look if it is better compared to my build, like better GPU which means higher consumption, higher CPU, higher ram, fans, etc. Thank you so much for your help! Keep safe!

Ps. I have no intention of overclocking GPU and CPU, maybe ram someday. And for activity, basically light gaming (Dota 2), photoshop, and clip studio paint. Thank you!"

buildapc,Planning on building a PC,"Hi, this is my first time posting on this subreddit. 

  
I am planning on building a PC which would work as my workstation rig for my personal learning ( AI/ML and that kind of stuff) along with hardcore gaming. I have been following some of the news and was thinking of waiting until the end of this year to get the new 7000 series processors from AMD and the RTX 4000 series graphic cards. My question is that does the generation gap make a good amount of difference to wait for it ? Or should I build one now, in that case it would be a 5950x paired with a rtx 3090. I havent come across any decent AI specific cards that could still beat the RTX 3090, especially with the 24 GB VRAM even in its inflated price range, so any suggestions on that would also be really helpful.

  
Thanks"

buildapc,I spilled water on my system. It's completely dry but still won't turn on. What can I do from here?,"Hi everyone. Long story short, I spilled water and completely dried everything.

I'm running the pc on a test bench, but nothing seems to work r n.

If I plug in my peripherals the led lights turn on. But when I try to turn it on, via shorting the power on front io, nothing happens.

buildapc,Tips and Questions on Upgrading an Older Gaming PC,"Hey all, new to the PC building scene. Got donated an old gaming computer from my dad that he built back some time between 2009-2011, and it's the first actual gaming PC I've ever had. I'm looking to upgrade some of the components now that it's been over a decade and have some questions. I want to make it a gaming/streaming/work PC (engineering work, so CAD and simulation programs that can be pretty graphically and computationally intensive).

Here are the current specs on it:

Motherboard: EVGA X58 3X SLI (supports threeway SLI with 3 PCIe 2.0 slots supporting 36 total lanes: X16, X16/X8, X8)

GPU: Nvidia GTX 690 (have three of them I can work with, currently only has one in the PCIe X16 slot)

CPU: Intel i7-975 (Corsair watercooler)

Memory: 4x2 GB Corsair Dominator GT DDR3 2000 PC3 16000 (originally had 6, two of them broke somehow long ago so it has two empty slots, supports interleaving)

Hard Drive: OS is on a 240 GB OCZ RevoDrive 3 X2 PCIe SSD in the X8 slot and a 256 GB Samsung 840 EVO SSD for storage hooked to the motherboard

Power Supply: PC Power &amp; Cooling Turbo-Cool 1200W

I'm looking to upgrade the memory, hard drives, and GPU. I want to run two GTX 690s in SLI in the X16 and X16/X8 slots so it can (for the time being) at least keep up with streaming more recent games at a decent 60+ fps without sacrificing graphics too much. Not looking to buy newer GPUs for now as the market and my wallet do not agree with each other. With this configuration I should be able to achieve that, as well as easily render any complex assemblies I'd need to do in CAD. SLI might be a bit outdated but it is what it is.

For the memory, I'd love to fill it back up with another set of 6x2 GB DDR3 2000 sticks, but I cannot find them (for a reasonable price). I'll have to downgrade to DDR3 1600 or 1866 to fill them all back up again (I'd rather have 12 GB at 1600/1866 than leave it at 8 GB at 2000). The motherboard only supports 12 GB of RAM so that's why I'm not just going for 32 GB and calling it there (also supposedly filling up all the RAM slots should maximize their capability with interleaving, still trying to figure that out though).

For hard drives, I want to run two new 1 TB Samsung 870 EVO SSDs in RAID 0 with an X8 SATA III PCIe RAID controller to maximize read/write speeds and update the capabilities from SATA II (and allow for future possibilities of running RAID 1, 1+0, 5, etc configurations for backup as data corruption could be very costly with work).

tl;dr upgrading the memory from 8 GB to 12 GB, hard drives from \~500 GB to 2 TB SATA III in RAID 0, and GPU to two GTX 690s with SLI

Some questions I had:

Will running an X1, X2, or X4 PCIe RAID Controller in the third X8 PCIe slot with the two GPUs in the X16 and X16/X8 slots impact their performance in any way? And will running a lower than X8 RAID controller slow down its own reading/writing speed?

Similar question, if I were to put an X8 RAID controller in the X8 slot, then technically one GPU would be at X16 and the other at X8 (at least according to the motherboard manual for how the lanes are split for 3 way SLI GPUs). Is that correct, or am I missing something? If it is correct, how would SFR or AFR handle with the GPUs operating with differing numbers of lanes (like would one be ""lagging"" more than the other, causing potential stuttering or frame drops)? Or is it just not possible that way and both GPUs would need to run at X8 somehow?

Is there anything specific I should be looking for for the new RAM to make sure they can support interleaving, or is that handled on the motherboard side? (I ask because I'm really struggling to find anything more about interleaving online besides explanations of what it is.)

Lastly, any suggestions or comments? Anything else I should try to upgrade that may cause bottlenecks in the upgrades I want to add? The only two things I don't want to touch right now are the motherboard and GPUs, those can be future things when price is less of an object. I'm really excited to learn so anything is appreciated!"
buildapc,"Got a 12900k for cheap, upgrading MOBO and cooler. Should I upgrade anything else?","Recently I purchased a new 12900k for cheap and am going to finally upgrade my pc.

buildapc,"Computer won’t turn on at all, no matter what I do","Hey all, so about 7-8 months ago I built a computer with my uncle, and it worked out fine, almost no issues besides me forgetting to install drivers (lol)

Fast forward a few days ago, I ordered a new mobo and cooler because I didn’t wanna deal with the 212 evo again.


So my current specs are


R5 2600
Aorus b450m
Noctua NHU12s Redux
Rx 570 8gb
WD sn550 1tb
Corsair 750w 80+ gold unit
Crucial Ballistix 16gb 3200mhz


And it’s continuing to have the same issue, when I tried hooking up the old psu the fan spins for a short second and then shuts off , and there’s no fan spin at all for the newer one



Some important things to note


I have gone through many, many checklists and none of them worked.

I have completely rebuilt the system multiple times

I have tried with one stick of ram, no luck

I have tried with a different cooler, no luck

The debug lights on my old mobo would flash for a split second to show debug lights, and the lights that would turn on were vga, dram, and boot.


I have tried almost everything. If anyone at all can figure out what’s wrong with my pc that would be great. Thanks."

I would have loved to build my own, but everywhere I looked was out of parts. Nobody had any clue when GPUs would be back in stock, and the prices I was seeing were absolutely insane especially in the used market. A friend of mine had a prebuilt from CyberPower, and said he loved it, but I see a lot of people bitching on the internet about quality control and weak psus. 

Am I making a mistake by buying this machine? I dont want to hose $1200, but at the same time, it feels like this is the best deal. I get super anxious anytime I spend a lot of money, so I'm not sure if I'm just getting overly anxious or if this is something I should be legitimately worried about"
buildapc,Lines on display,"Ok so long story short a buddy of mine got lines on his display and asked me to fix it. I've replaced the HDMI cable, the gpu, the motherboard, and the monitor. In that order. And there are still lines on the display that scale with the resolution and I just don't get it. I have gone to my wits end about this and cannot figure it out. He had a 1070 and I replaced it with a brand new 1660 Super, had an older MB that I replaced with an equivalent but slightly used (however I did test it before changing it and it didn't have issues), and replaced the monitor with my own that still works so ruled that out. 

The lines scale with the resolution and are always a certain number of pixels apart, they ONLY appear while in windows and not while in bios, the PC works and boots and runs completely fine, but there are annoying lines running down the screen and I don't get it. 

Would post pictures but forgot to take some before leaving the last time. Does anyone know what could be causing this at this point or is he just gonna have to deal with it? Could it be the CPU? I do make sure that the HDMI cable is plugged into the gou and not the motherboard."
buildapc,Please help me figure out why my graphics card died.,"Hello, I recently swapped out cases for my pc. I was playing Minecraft on it after I installed all the parts, and everything was working fine. All of a sudden after I turned it off and tried to turn it back on, it stopped working. When I plug in the cable directly from the motherboard to the monitor everything works fine. I tried reseating the 1060 and that didn’t work. Also, I even noticed the fans don’t spin when the card is connected to the PSU via PCIe (non-modular).

Specs: I’m using the iCue 4000x RGB case by Corsair.

**Information**

I have read the sidebar. I am building a PC that will be used 90% by my wife for home office but 10% by me for some PC games. I am okay with xbox-like performance, e.g. 30 fps 1080p medium graphics is fine by me. I would like to have moderate but stable performance. Low maintenance is a priority so I want to avoid things that will over-complicate the build or upkeep. 

**Questions**

Hi all, my build is above. I posted yesterday and basically changed everything in my build after reading the feedback and doing a bunch of reading. I have a few questions after researching all day.

1) XMP - This is a RAM ""overclock"" preset in some motherboards right? This motherboard says it will has XMP up to 5000+ mhz. That means when I set up my PC I want to turn on the XMP setting in the BIOS so that I can get the full 3600mhz speed out of my RAM which will be important for my APU set up, right? Is there anything I need to know about XMP? Are there risks? Is there anything with voltage I need to know to not fry my RAM or worse? I see flck and other similar acronyms and ratios but I'm hoping it is just as simple as turning on the XMP setting and that will get me where I need...is that correct?

2) If I want to use the RGB in my RAM or RGB case fans or a separate RGB strip, will this set up let me go that route? Is there something I need to look at on the motherboard specs to see if it is compatible? 

3) I was initially going to go with the substantially cheaper ASRock b450 motherboard ($129 vs $209) but I read that there are BIOS issues. That if it doesn't ship with the latest BIOS compatible with my 5600G CPU then I would need to get an older CPU to flash (meaning update right?) the BIOS? I read the advantage of this more expensive Gigabyte board is that it has a physical flash button I can press when I plug in the USB so it doesn't matter if it comes incompatible with my CPU and I have no standalone GPU to access the BIOS, all I need is a USB flash drive. Am I more or less understanding the BIOS issues and why it is worth more money for the Gigabyte mobo? (I also read the Gigabyte mobo is more reliable with the XMP settings for the RAM which also makes it worthwhile? Does this seem true and worth the extra $80?)"

buildapc,Do I need to upgrade?,"Hello,

I'm not entirely new to PC building, but Ive been out of the loop for a bit and I do know things are pricey nowadays. I FEEL like i need to upgrade my computer now to play some games with friends. Things like Halo Infinite, B4B, Monster Hunter. I mostly play RPGs like The Witcher 3, pre-ordering Horizon and Elden Ring. I want to enjoy them to their full potential.

buildapc,What is the front I layout for a Segotep b560i cvn motherboard,"Hit everyone. I built an i5 11400f with an rtx3060 build and today, about 6 hours ago, I spilled water all iver my parts.

I have thoroughly dried every nook and cranny of the each component, completely disassembling them in the process. I used my dorms hand dryer thingy in the bathroom to ensure all moisture was gone.

Rebuilding the machine on a test bench(mobo box) when I plug in my peripherals, the RGB lights light up. When I try to turn it on however, nothing seems to work.

I lost the original manual for the motherboard so I can't refer to that. Segotep is a cringe company and I can't find the manual online either.

I tried different combinations trying to short the power cycle to turn on but nothing works.

If you have the same board, what is the layout?

- Do you think the CPU cooler will be enough? I was reading some reviews and it seems good enough.
- Is the power supply good? I’ve read cases of people skimping out on power supply’s and frying their whole build 
- Do I have to buy an OEM for windows 10? I saw a few videos of people just making a flash drive and installing Windows 10 and then buying an activation code for cheap.

When I say ""change"", I can only give some recent examples. In CSGO sometimes when a smoke grenade goes off, the black screen happens. In Dark Souls 3, sometimes in the middle of a boss fight as soon as I trigger the second stage of the boss, the black screen happens. In Before Your Eyes, sometimes when transitioning from one chapter / scene to the next, the black screen will happen. Im just confused because it's never consistent. Usually as soon as I reset my pc and try to do the same thing again, it'll work fine.

H610 offers garbage level of expandability and going H670 / Z690 with an i3 isn't very wallet-friendly either. and the CPU itself is selling for Approx. 165USD here

Meanwhile second-hand bundles like X79 Sabertooth with i7-3930K selling for only 120USD, which sounds pretty decent for me, considering it has 6C/12T like modern i5 CPU standards and doesn't cost a leg.

current PC is running off an i5-2500k and H77 mobo with a 1650S which sometimes lags when the scene gets intensive. I mainly play World Of Warships , probably most graphical intensive game would be GTA V.

So I just moved the sliding bracket until it fit the holes on the motherboard (the LGA1200 holes actually, it's an Asus board which has both LGA1200 and LGA1700 mounting holes), then screwed in the heatsink.

I noticed the motherboard curve slightly, like the corners weren't lying flat on the surface anymore. So I put the mobo in the case and screwed it in which keeps it flat/straight.

However, while doing this the sides of my case were off in the event that I needed to make some final changes. When I finally put the case together, a wire was hitting one of my GPU fans. I went to move the wire out of the way with a knife ( I believe I didn't do any damage to the motherboard but at this point now I'm not certain) and since then my keyboard, mouse, and monitor do not turn on when the PC does. 

On top of that, I have the cooler master MB320L case which has a power button of its own. Before this issue, the button was able to turn the PC on and off with one click. However, now it can only turn the PC on and will not turn it off. 

Everything with RGB (RAM, GPU, and Case) turns on, so I'm honestly quite confused as to what is causing this problem. Any thoughts, ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks for the help."
buildapc,GeForce GTX 1660 Super tower or RTX 3060 laptop?,"I'm in the market for my first gaming rig and am looking at pre-builts and laptops. I'm looking to spend about $1000-$1200 maximum, just looking to game with friends for fun and don't need the best of the best. I'd rather buy from Best Buy/Costco/Walmart/etc even if it isn't the best deal around since they're local and it's easier to deal with possible returns if anything is wrong. Because of that I'm not looking at newegg, ebay, microcenter, antonline, etc. 

I went to a few shops the other day and in my price range the PCs I'm most interested in are the Lenovo Legion 5 Tower from Costco on sale for $850 ( Intel i5-11500, GeForce GTX 1660 Super, 16GB ram) and the Lenovo Legion 7 Slim open box for $1039 from Best Buy (AMD Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3060 Max-Q, 16GB ram).

I don't really care about portability, if I get the 7 Slim it'll be hooked up to an external monitor 100% of the time while closed on my desk or possibly only used as an external screen for discord. I just want whichever of these 2 will give me the best gaming performance. If the RTX 3060 will allow me to get notably better performance at 1080p for an extra couple years over the 1660S then the extra money is worth it to me, but if not then I'm thinking I'd might as well just settle with the 1660S and call it a day. 

Which one do you guys think I should go for? Thanks"
buildapc,Is this PC a good buy?,"I am not that into computer builds, i only have some idea about what's good and what is not. So i was hoping that i could get some help from one of you. I have the option to buy the following PC for 920 USD. My main priority is Rust on some decent looking graphics. Is it a good buy?

\- GTX Titan Z, 12gb.

\- I7-4770K.

\- 16gb ram.

\- 480gb SSD.

\- 1.000gb HDD.

\- 850W Gigabyte Power supply.

\- RGB cabinet.

\- RGB CPU-cooler."
buildapc,Does this parts list look good?,"this is my first time building a pc so the part selection might not be great. I plan on using this with a 1660 ti for now until gpu prices go down a bit. I know watercooling isnt necessary for a 11400 but it looks cool and i want a nice looking system.

[https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/FLFq68](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/FLFq68)

buildapc,"Not the most experienced in PC building, nor do I know if my parts are good or not."," I got my PC from a friend whenever he upgraded his, and am just wondering if what I got is good or if I should upgrade some things. Upgrades could be expensive or cheap, as I'm thinking more in the long term, upgrading things one by one. It's about 5 or 4 years old and and the specs are:

Intel i7-8700,

GeForce GTX 1060 3GB,

buildapc,Monitor Ghosting,"So I went to micro center and bought the ASUS VG27WQ1B 27"" 2K WQHD (2560 x 1440) 165Hz Curved Screen Gaming Monitor, and while im  pleased with the picture quality, it is ghosting and leaving pixel trails so horribly. It has a 1ms response time, but I don't know if there's any settings that I need to change, but I'm close to returning the monitor cause it's so bad. Any ideas how to fix it?"
buildapc,Cooling components other than CPU,"Good evening all,
I finally have obtained a graphics card, so I can go ahead and finish my gaming build, however I have a question on cooling.

I don’t see anyone talk about cooling anything other than their CPU, unless they use a custom loop. I’m planning to get an AIO Liquid Cooler for my CPU, however is there anything you need for like GPU or RAM or anything else? Or are the case fans normally good enough to not require one.

I’d do a custom loop but I’m too scared to do it on my first PC build"
buildapc,Booting up requires both drives to be detected. How do I move contents and partition?,"I'm stuck and can't figure this out. My windows 10 PC requires both my original ssd and hard drive to be detected to boot. I believe there is a partition in one of the drives that needs to be copied over. 

I bought a new NVME (2tb) that is larger than the data used on my current system. Can you guys help me consolidate the drives? 

I'm a photographer and I use Adobe Lightroom and it's important that I don't screw up the catalogue. 

I have downloaded and watched many videos on aomei and minidisk partition wizard. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated"
buildapc,FoR the AIO pros,"Hey guys, Im planning on installing an AIO (240mm) in front of my case (First Build). While researching, I've read about mounting of AIO affects its lifespan and performance. With the case that I have, my only choice of mounting is through front (inlet). https://imgur.com/gallery/vqr4y3M . Ive posted a different Front orientation of the AIO. Could u guys tell me which one would be the best orientation for the AIO front mounting.

Thank you"

I've had this built for a year or two now except for the ram which I'm planning  on swapping out, and the M.2 drive that I want to add in. I'm mostly novice when it comes to parts and interactions but my main concerns are if overheating will be an issue with one intake fan and one outtake fan. I don't plan on overclocking ram, just the advertised 3200

I mainly use my computer for medium/high intensity gaming. I'm replacing the previous ram I had because it had various issues (at least I'm fairly sure that's what caused it) that caused occasional bluescreens on startup. The M.2 drive is more of a luxury choice item than anything.

Overall I'm wondering if there are any glaring flaws to this build that I may have missed"

I usually use my pc for things such as gaming (would like to get a constant 120+ FPS for my monitor) and heavy tasks such as editing.

Would r5 1600 also perform better on games such as valorant where only one core is prioritised? And would using applications such as process lasso help me allow games to use more cores?

Would it also be worth overclocking?

buildapc,12th Generation Intel: Pre-included CPU cooler VS third-party CPU coolers,"I remember how my prehistoric i7-4790K had its own cooler in the box back in 2K14, back to my first-ever build. Now (at last) I'm building my second-ever build on a shiny *ASUS TUF GAMING Z690-PLUS D4*. Being used to a good ethernet connection, I opted for the non-Wi-Fi version.

My questions are as much based on ignorance and curiosity as on budget VS value.

Performance-wise, should I opt for a CPU independently of what I find included in the box, or should I look for one that has its own cooler from Intel?

What budget (but good) coolers are you using that fit in a Corsair 4000D Mid-Tower for your 12th Generation bad boys?

I didn't do anything to it when I got it and I only had it about a day before it died.) Long story short it fried the motherboard. Looking for a replacement motherboard as the motherboard that's in it is about 3 years old at this point and I'm only able to find it used for like $300. I don't want to pay $300 for a used motherboard, especially since I just paid for a gaming rig. Im just trying to see if there's a cheaper option.

buildapc,LGA 1700 Mounts,"Hi all, about to build my first ever PC in the next week or so, and I have an Intel LGA 1700 CPU. I’m just now discovering the current LGA 1700 mounting crisis with many liquid coolers. I have the Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML360 Mirror, which of course doesn’t have a mount comparible with LGA 1700.

buildapc,New Graphics card needed (old one is dead) replacing/upgrading RX480,"Hi all 3rd post in a few days here.

So my graphics card is dead and obviously the market sucks, I was planning on doing a new build in 2 years so I think my plan here is to buy a graphics card that would work for that build (so basically buying something that might be good for 5 years).

All I use it for is gaming (at least that is graphically intensive) I play League of legends mostly but also like to play games like Valheim and Raft and Minecraft and run servers for those games. I enjoy the really good story games as well like Witcher 3 (kinda wish I could even run this on full settings), and want to try New World (even if it might suck or whatever now, basically just want the ability to try what games I want).

My budget is say $1000 cause I feel like I have to put it that high for what I want but I am hoping to not have to spend all 1000 so anything below is great too.

Here is my build, which I have added too (2 more sticks of the same RAM, and another SSD of the same size)

Before installing it I noticed that my PSU only has 2 8 pin power connectors. However, both of the PCIe power cables are split at the ends. Would it be safe to install 1 cable into the center spot of the GPU power connectors and then split the other cables between the two ends? It seems it should be able to since the GPU should only require 350-400 watts and I would be able to supply 600 watts?

buildapc,What is a current minimum build for watching videos at full resolution on HP Reverb G2 VR headset?,"Goal: Use HP Reverb G2 headset.

Subgoal: Utilize components from current build if possible.

Apart from the RAM, current (old) build has maybe one useful part or none:
Intel Core i5 4460 3.20GHz
16.0GB Dual-Channel DDR3 798MHz
Lenovo Sharkbay motherboard

Is this processor slightly too bad or just barely good enough for HP Reverb G2? They say i5 is good enough, but there are new models of that, so maybe this old model is bad? How can it be known?

My initial research says Sharkbay is outdated for this purpose, but I am not sure because this feels like rocket science to me with all the options available.

I would not want to overkill the build, but I know very little about PC building so all advice is greatly appreciated."
buildapc,Are 100c CPU tempe too high?,"I have a i5 7600k and its a 100 degrees celcius at all times while playing. Recently got very ba doerformamce ingame, does the temp affect performance?"
buildapc,Ended up with 2 SSDs: Intel 1TB 670p vs Western Digital 1TB Green SN350. Which to use?,"I'm cobbling together a computer and got all the parts in except the pair of Intel 1TB 670p M.2 SSDs, which got lost in the mail (thanks FedEx). After waiting well over a week, I went and ordered the WD Green 1TB SN350 M.2 SSDs. Of course, then the lost package showed up and now I have both. I paid $79.99 each for both the Intel and WD drives, so I'll be returning one set. I just don't know which I should go with, because I don't understand SSD specs well enough to distinguish.

Here's the rest of the build (most of which is hand-me-down, used stuff):
MOBO: Asus ROG Strix X470 Gaming
CPU: Ryzen 5 2600
RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB DDR4 3600

buildapc,Thermal paste coverage,"I just installed the arctic freezer 34 esports duo cpu cooler on a ryzen 5 cpu, but realized that it doesn't cover the entire cpu. Apparently it's designed to work like that, so i'm not too worried, but I do have another problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Because I didn't realize this beforehand, I put the thermal paste on my cpu in an x shape and some of the corners have not been covered by the cooler. Will that be a problem? Will I need to remove the excess with a paper towel? None of the paste has actually spilt off my cpu btw, just that it's not covered by the cooler"

What about dual rank, single rank, ECC, and die? How do I know what to get? There are so many brands and models. I want to get the best choice to last me several years. If 4x8GB is better, I don't mind because I won't need 64GB anytime soon."

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

*Problem 1*:  Recorded 88 degrees temp in CPU stress test. Dangerous levels.

*Problem 2*:  AIDA64 hardware failure results (less than 10min) (was only stressing the memory in this case)

*Problem 3*:  Certain games crashed after 10min (like Civ VI); old systems never crashed once. Windows was still stable, but game had an exception error.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

AIDA64 gives hardware failure in less than 10min with only the memory-test enabled (can this still be a CPU hardware issue if not stressing the CPU?) CPU temps were fine (55ish)

* What temps should I expect?

Sometimes when using my computer, it will go seemingly unresponsive, but I can minimize/close the app (when hitting close it closes the window but it still looks ""open"" on the taskbar). I can also use my mouse and click on things on my desktop (nothing opens). It seems to sit like this until I force restart. I have never had this issue while gaming for some reason.

I've always had Nvidia originally I had an old HP pc that only had intigrated graphics but put a Nvidia 1050 in. Then I bought a pre-built from Best buy and it has a 1060 3g.

here's the build: 

[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/cBk7rr](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/cBk7rr)

&amp;#x200B;

CPU   i7 12700k

MB     MSI Z690A ddr4

PSU    Seasonic Focus GX 1000w

RAM   Kingston 32gb Beast 3600mhz

(im aware PSU and RAM are a bit overkill but im fine with that) 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the cooler in question is :  Cooler Master Masterair MA620M - Is it good enough for i7

And the case is ether :

 COOLER MASTER MASTERBOX LITE 5 ARGB (that I don't think is properly vented)

 COOLER MASTER MASTERBOX MB500 (that i think has a bit better vent)

I'm wondering are any of these good and if not it would be cool to recommend me some.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think that CPU and MB will be good together but im not 100% sure. I'm like 99% sure everything is compatible

What do you think about my build overall?

&amp;#x200B;

GPU will probably be 3060 ti, 3080 or 3050 - (when i get medical confirmation i can sell my kidney)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"
buildapc,Ram timings?,"Hello , i recently installed Corsair Vengeance LPX 3600 18-22-22-42 on my Asrock B450 steel and Ryzen 1600AF.

buildapc,Could this be upgraded to the equivalent of an xbox series x?,"https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/332805305381478/?ref=facebook_story_share

Sorry if its not allowed. Im not sure as im not asking for suggestions for a prebuilt as much as if this prebuilt on marketplace will allow me to upgrade and what parts would need to be upgraded. Lately just really been feeling the limitations of consoles and would love to get into pc gaming but know ill still be able to play the next elder scrolls when it comes out on lower settings at least if nothing else. Was looking at steam and very much considering it but im just not sure how long something like that would last before you cant play anything new on it. I saw someone on youtube use an older model pc and upgrade a few parts and do kinda decent and have seen others comment on upgrading local prebuilt pcs and doing pretty well so really trying to figure this stuff out. All the compatibility stuff is very confusing to me though. Any help would be much appreciated. If this can be upgraded to a series x equivalent ill probably sell my series s and switch to pc gaming and slowly upgrade."

Both drives sit around 80-120gb free each. I been thinking about getting more storage some games with huge texture packs are loading somewhat slow on the hard drive. So I been thinking should I maybe invest in a ssd ether 1tb or 2tb nvme or sata or get another 4tb wd black and raid 0 for performance.

I’m not concerned about data redundancy because it just holds games so if one craps out I just re download games.

To put some cost into perspective because I’m Canadian the wd black is about $180, the evo 970 evo nvme 1tb is also about $180 and a 2tb Samsung blue ssd sata 3 is about $248"

Do I need to buy any additional parts, such as a fan hub? if not, how can i solve this issue? the fans can't turn without the 3 pins, because there is rgb but no turning.

I paid $750 for this, and while I was kinda wary of being scammed when initially messaging him, I think I bought this from a pretty cool dude. His 2070ti just died on him and decided to sell me what I think was his secondary PC. He was much more of an enthusiast than I am, which honestly made me feel really comfortable with the deal. Also, apparently people were low-balling him? His original price was $900 which I believe was almost worth to begin with.

buildapc,will a 2070 super work with this mobo?,"the mobo is an eATX from 2013 by EVGA, it’s model name is: EVGA 152-HW-E878-KR

A friend of mine tried to run a 2070 super on the mobo, but says he could barely run league of legends. i tested the 2070 super in another friends PC, and the 2070 worked flawlessly. 

It lead me to believe that it might’ve just been a software bug, since the 2070 on the mobo was still displaying signal and still processing graphics, just not to its fullest. 

is it common for graphics cards to not work properly in that sort of way? where the GPU seems to work, but just barely?

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I'm mostly unsure about the cooling. A simple fan vs some liquid cooling.

RGB isn't that important to me, it's just accidentaly present on some parts.

I'm choosing to go without a GPU, since the prices are crazy, and I don't need it for my usecases.

I already have an old 450W PSU, I'm not actualy buying that 450W PSU

All feedback appreciated"

buildapc,Feedback/Advice for new build,"Hi all,

I'm planning to build a new pc for mainly gaming purposes. My old one is slowly but surely showing its age. Since i used parts that were recommended by a friend for the old one this will be my first own build.

After quite some hours of research i ended up with the list below.

As GPU i will use the GTX 1060 from my old build until i can find a new one for a reasonable price somewhere.

Would be grateful for any feedback or advice.

buildapc,Upgrading from 4690k to 5600x or 5800x," 

Hi Guys,

Im currently picking my parts for my new build, im curious about your tips.

I would like to play at 1440p but 120fps is alright for me.

My goal is to have a RTX3070, but that the time for writing i cant cope one, so i want my system to be ready for the 3070 drop.

The goal setup is:

* AMD 5600x ***OR*** 5800x (im not sure if the 100dollar/euro more is worth it for 2 more cores?)  
That is because i like to turn dual-monitor setup, like to have a lot of chrome tabs open but i'm not rendering or use adobe after effects i.e
* RTX3070 (at this moment the RTX1060)
* 32GB of RAM at 3200mts
* NVMe SSD 1TB
* Corsair RM750X

Should i go for the 5600x or 5800x?  
The price at my shop in the netherlands differs 100 euro 

Thanks guys!!"
buildapc,Arctic Liquid Freezer 2 LGA 1700 Bracket shipping to Canada,"Anyone request or order an Arctic Liquid Freezer 2 LGA 1700 mounting kit for delivery to Canada recently?  Looking for timeframe estimates..

I'd order one off Amazon but its only available on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) and not [amazon.ca](https://amazon.ca) so the $7 part ends up being $32 CDN with next week delivery.  

I requested the free LKGA 1700 kit from Arctic in Late December which was sent out regular post from Germany.  However there's no tracking number.  Since I ordered 2  Freezer AIO coolers I got them to send LGA 1700 kit from the US to Canada.  Which they shipped out USPS - again no delivery estimate.

I'm tried of looking at 2 new systems that I can't power on.  Every day I get closer to returning the coolers and buying something else with LGA 1700 support out of the box."
buildapc,Looking for help building a budget/mid-range PC,"Hey everyone,

I've been rocking my I7-3820k for about 8 and a half years and it's been really solid, however I think it's about time for an upgrade. I've been looking around trying to figure out the best combination for CPU/Mobo/RAM/cooler with a budget of around $700. I already have the PSU, GPU (GTX 1060 3 GB), and case, and so far this is what I've come up with:

- Intel I5-12400F ($180)
- MSI MAG B660 TOMAHAWK WIFI DDR4 ($190)
- G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) CL16 3600MHz ($75)
- Scythe Fuma 2 CPU Air Cooler (~$68 w/ LGA1700 mount)

It all comes out to about $510. I just have some questions with the RAM and cooler, I did some research and a lot of people recommended the scythe fuma 2, but maybe someone knows a cheaper alternative? I don't know how much cooling I'd actually need for a 12400f, I've never had liquid cooling but I don't think it's necessary for this build, especially with it being generally more expensive. I know that the 12400F comes with its own stock cooler but so far I haven't heard many good things about it, so I'd feel safer swapping it for a new one.

Also there aren't a lot of B660 mobos available right now, however this one seems to be the best as far as features go while being at least $30 cheaper than the cheapest Z690 boards, and even including WiFi.

If anyone knows of any alternatives to any of these parts I'd greatly appreciate it! I'll mostly just do light gaming (League, Valorant, WoW) and some office work with it, I just want to make sure to minimize potential build mistakes.

Thank you so much!"

But I am not sure which RAM to get I want it to have RGB and within budget of £200. Below are the three different sticks I am thinking about chosing from with an little explanation on each of them.

1st: https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/cfVmP6/corsair-vengeance-rgb-rt-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr4-3600-cl16-memory-cmn32gx4m2z3600c16

I know it is corsair and this is looked down upon due to the instability and inconsistancy. However is of course looks good and is resonably priced.

2nd: https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/Gxt9TW/team-t-force-xtreem-argb-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr4-4000-cl18-memory-tf10d432g4000hc18ldc01

This is my currant fav and is what I am most likely thinking about going with. I know it has slower timing however I have heard you can down clock the speed to sharpen the timing which if this is possible its probably what I will do (please let me know if it is possible with this ram). Also it is well within budget and looks very nice.

3rd: https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/Qh2bt6/crucial-ballistix-rgb-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr4-3600-memory-bl2k16g36c16u4rl

I know what your thinking the red looks quite terrible however the black one is completely sold out apart from newegg which is from US and means I will have to pay import tax. I like the look of this again and the timings are nice but I have heard the software is really bad to use and dosent work half of the time.

I am really thankful that you read through that and I would love to hear your opinions on the three and which ones you think I should buy, especially your comments on the 2nd RAM I posted thanks."
buildapc,Which m.2 slot should I use?,"I have a MSI b550 pro vdh wifi, which has two m.2 slots. The first one supports Pcie 3 and Pcie4 and is connected to processor while the second one supports only pcie 3 and is connected to chipset. I only have one storage devise, a samsung 970 evo plus, which I believe is Pcie 3. Which m.2 slot should I put it in?"
buildapc,"Questions about USBs, USB hubs, wireless dongles and controllers?","I'm trying to sort out the wires in my PC area and I have some questions.

1. Can you connect multiple 2.4GHz wireless dongles connected to the same USB Hub without increasing input latency?
2. Can you connect multiple xbox controlles to the same USB hub without adding any input latency?
3. Do does it even work to connect multiple input devices to the same USB Hub or does something happen to the data that way?
4. Can you connect multiple Xbox controllers to the same 2.4GHz dongle without the same issue?
5. Would adding a USB Extension cable to any of these devices also add any input lag?"

I used my old RTX 2060 single fan, and bought a Montech Flyer case with some RGB built in.  

Added RGB RAM sticks and EZDIY FAB cable combs/extensions.  Total cost is about $600.

Anyone who successfully did it?"
buildapc,B550,"I am new to PC building and am currently looking for a motherboard for my Gaming PC. I decided I am going to look for a B550 motherboard because it is compatible with the Ryzen 3 3100 CPU I chose, and from of the boards I have seen on Amazon, B550 looks cheaper than X570. I have a couple questions though.

1. Will B550 decrease the overall performance of my PC compared to an X570?
2. What is the differences between B550 and X570?
3. I have seen a lot of boards that say they are B550M-PLUS, B550M, B550-A, B550-F, etc. I am kind of confused about why it has all that extra stuff after B550. Why does it say that after B550? Is it a different chipset than B550 or is it just for the name?
4. Also, will I need a BIOS update for a B550 motherboard? If I need a BIOS update for some B550 motherboards but not all, then how do I know it won't need a BIOS update?
5. If I get a better CPU in the future (for example, upgrading to a Ryzen 5 5600x), will I need to buy a new motherboard?"
buildapc,How many fans do I need for the Fractal Design Meshify C ATX case?,"Hello currently still in the process of building my first PC here, I bought a Meshify C ATX case awhile back but realized I'd like some RGB fans to enhance the appearance

I ended up purchasing the Cooler Master Masterfan MF120R RGB 3-pack to display at the front of the case however I'm still new to PC building and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to buy another 3 to put at the rear end as well? or is just 3 fans enough? I'm aware this PC case already comes with fans but I heard some people say that all case fans should have the exact same RPM and CFM to get the best airflow possible but I have no idea how true this is.

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

buildapc,£200 PC Help,"Hi, I've only ever built a pc one before and that was with a ton of help luckily it was at the start of the whole inflation. Amazed by my pc my little cousin wants a PC too he has a budget of around £150 - £200 and I'm not really sure what to get him, I have no clue on low end items as my budget was a lot higher so I never researched them.

I watched a guide for this and did it how the guide showed but yeah didn't help.

Im teribbly sorry for my bad english im a bit distracted while tiping this."
buildapc,no room for wifi card + GPU,"So today i copped a msi gaming x rtx 3060. Before I had a PC with a Ryzen 5 3600, MSI B450M Pro-VDH Max and my old GTX 960 4gb. Thing is, i just moved to my college city and I only have wifi in my room. Thats why i got the WBAX200 wifi pci-e wifi card by Gigabyte Aorus. It worked. My GPU was in my PCIE x16 and covered one of my PCIE x1 slots. I had 2 tho and used the lower one for my wifi card. Now that I got the RTX 3060, that thing is fat as shit. It covers both of my pcie x1 slots so I cannot use my rtx 3060 with internet access since the fckn pcie card has nowhere to go. tf do I do now?
I had 2 ideas:

1. Buy a shitty USB WiFi adapter and cry in pain, high latency and package losses while playing games. 

2. Buy a PCIe x1 riser and cry in pain because the space between my GPU and the x1 slots is basically zero so I wont even be able to attach a riser into the lower x1. 

Now I am sitting here like a dumbass with my 3060 and still have to play with my 960. Any solutions?
I also got a i9 10900k for 250€ that sold me the 3060. Should I just quickly build a new PC on a z490 ATX board thats large enough so I can put both my GPU and WiFi card inside? Or are there any short term solutions to use the 3060 in my old ryzen 5 pc?

Also bought 2x 16GB ddr4 DIMM 4400mhz for 140€ from him. So is the quickest fix to just build a new PC from the 10900k? I pretty much only need a z490 mainboard."
buildapc,Is my Mobo missing an M2 Riser?,Started putting my new build together and although I see where the second M2 slot is towards the bottom of the picture it seems like I'm missing a riser to put an M2 screw in to keep it flat and secure? The heatsink has one on the bottom but I assume that's to extend it past the first M2 and secure it.
buildapc,pc upgrade suggestions?,"so right now i have a pc with a 10600k and a 1070 ti, i'd say it gets okay fps on most games but i'm looking for something more. i'd prefer to get a consistent 260-300fps on fortnite. i'd wanna spend around $2k for the pc and since i produce music, do amd gpus do well on rendering workstation type stuff?"
buildapc,Good price for second hand parts,"My brother is interested in building a gaming pc to try. He doesn’t like mine that much so he doesn’t want to go all out.  I was planing on upgrading soon and he said he would buy the parts.  What’s a good second hand price for

buildapc,Stripped screw on cooler retention bracket. Screw Extractor questions?,"I ordered a screw extractor set to remove a stripped screw on my retention bracket.  
I'm gonna practice it on a test screw in the garage first, but I'm wondering what I should do about the metal shavings that might result from the use of such a set. I can vaccuum them out of my case for sure, but can I use a magnet (provided I keep the magnet away from my disk-based hard drives?)"
buildapc,"Looking to upgrade a 1060ti, need input","I'm looking to upgrade my Nvidia 1060 ti, and have a buddy that will sell me his 1 year used non-overclocked msi amd 5700xt for 400$. Based on numbers, this seems like a good deal and a decent upgrade as well.

buildapc,New computer won't boot,"Hello! I'm having issues with my new build, maybe someone can shed some light.

Build is:

MSI B550m PRO-VDH (not the WIFI version)

Ryzen 5 5600X

Corsair Vengeance LPX 2 x 16 GB RAM

SAMSUNG 970 Evo plus (non-formatted)

Crucial BX500 (linux installed)

GTX 980

When I turn on the computer, the fans spin normally, the CPU, VGA and BOOT LEDs on the mobo turn on one after the other for a few seconds and then off. DRAM LED doesn't turn on at all. All fans keep spinning, USB devices (keyboard, mouse) turn on, but no graphics output.

I tried swapping around the memory and booting with only one stick, no luck.

Tried changing the port on the back of the GPU.

Tried booting with only one of the drives and in different slots.

Flashed the BIOS on the mobo (LED kept blinking for a few minutes then it turned off then stopped, I believed it was successful). 

CPU went in nicely, pretty sure nothing got damaged.

Any suggestions on what I can try? I thought it could be CPU and flashed the BIOS, but now I'm suspecting it may be GPU. I bought it from a store, but it's used, so it could be bad.

buildapc,Looking for missing parts to secure Tempered Glass Panel on an iBuyPower Case Element PRO ARGB case.,"There are four, hard mounted, threaded screw posts protruding from the case that need fitted rubber washers and nuts to hold the tempered glass panel on. This pc was a very generous gift from my son, so I have no clue what the nuts even look like for this model. I've tried searching but since I don't know what they are called I'm not having great results. I do know that they are not the standard finger tightening case screws as those have the threaded screw post attached to them and screw into the case.

buildapc,EVGA Step Up Question For 3060 12GB,Anytime I get an alert for GPU stock I give it a shot for the hell of it. I scored a 3060 12GB from Best Buy for 429.00. I know they have the step up program. Is it worth it getting in the que for a 3060 TI? How far up do I have to go up where I'll really notice it? I don't need top of the line but was thinking maybe since it's an option I should at least get in line for it.
buildapc,New gaming PC build. Won’t boot windows after successful install.,"I am completely new to building computers and I have just finished up my first gaming PC build. Everything was smooth sailing after I figured out I needed to update my bios, then used a USB thumb drive to boot using the windows 10 ISO. I installed windows pretty easily and started using my computer flawlessly. All of a sudden my computer restarts and won’t boot up windows. Just displays “preparing auto repair.” Once it tries this it’ll just try to boot up again then give the option to shut off the computer or go to “advanced options.” 

I then find a quick fix on a YouTube video that instructed to turn the PC on and off at the manufacturer logo screen 3 times. Then, it loads into a different option page to go to advanced options, shut off PC, or continue into windows. Next I had to go to advanced options and select the command. The video instructed to type “bootrec /fixmbr” then “bootrec /rebuildbcd”. After this I left the command and just had to click continue to windows. Voila! It worked like a charm. Until I come back to my PC later after I put it in sleep and realize it had done it again. Same issue starting up and seeing the manufacturer logo screen with “preparing auto repair.” 

I then go into bios to see if I can mess with random settings to fix the issue and it seemed turning off “fast boot” was a fix because after it was disabled, Windows booted fine once again. Until 15 minutes later it crashes and restarts back at the same screen once again. Therefore, I’m not sure my attempts are actually working or if they’re just coincidentally happening at the same time my computer just decides to recognize windows or whatever it’s doing. 

The first fix won’t work anymore because it won’t go into the correct “repair mode” after turning it on and off 3 times like it did successfully the first time. So now I’m at a complete loss. Any help is appreciated.

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

I'm concerned about airflow. The only fan bringing air in are through the radiator, and I'm afraid this might be an issue. The part list above is not 100% accurate, due to the cyberpower water cooler and case can not be purchased. The linked ones are similar in fashion, pictures of my concern provided. 

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

Only real solution I see is to change my case, or to have top fan in, and back fan out. Currently they are both pushing air out.

**Post relevant photos of build/parts here.**

I'm someone who play at 720p 15fps low lmao on games like blade and soul with my R5 M430 and i consider buying this gpu since i don't had the occasion to buy a rx 6600xt. 

However i must say that i attach a lot of importance to value and idk how good will have resell value after this whole shortage end, i mean 4GB is very bad for modern titles, especially AAA open worlds that are games that i plan to mostly play on, 3050 showed it already so I'm not sure if i should buy it temporarily to sell it and get a better gpu later on ?

Another problem that i was planning to play 1440p AAA games with a 3070 and because of this situation 1080p will be better with a 6500xt but i mean a monitor is a long-term investment and 1080p should be already dead in normal times for me, so idk if 1440p can run 1080p but yeah 6500xt will not 1440p obviously."

For the i5 2500 (4 cores 4 threads) will get a mediocre Intel motherboard, stock cooler and 2 ram slots. Considering the budget I’m only able to obtain 4gb ddr3 sticks and for the i7 I could get max 16gb and the i5 8gb.

buildapc,Coil whine reduced by resetting PC?!,"Hello guys, thought I’d share a very bizarre occurrence. 

I’ve had a 3090 Strix oc for over a year and that card has always had insane coil whine, only made worse by the waterblock. 

It’s reduced slightly over the time I’ve had it, but under heavy load it’s unbearable without headphones. 

Today I decided to Reset my PC with a fresh Windows install to remove all the bloatware and unused programs I’ve collected and been too lazy to uninstall… after this I started playing some games and noticed the coil whine is basically gone. The GPU is still pulling the same amount of watts, boosting behaviour is the same. But the coilwhine is 90% gone.

I used UserBenchmark to get these results:
UserBenchmarks: Game 63%, Desk 79%, Work 48%

MBD: Gigabyte GA-H110M-A

I'm not concerned with graphics as much as I want the computer to run smoothly. I was thinking easy upgrades I could make is to the RAM, fans (I have a new CPU fan I just have yet to install it-oops!), and more memory (SSD/HDD). The little SSD I have has my OS on it.

It runs all my games perfectly fine, but some of my peripherals and other devices have been having strange cutting out issues, that I can only determine to be the power supply not being strong enough (I have like 6-8 peripherals plugged in at once, so I presume that's taking up a lot of power and messing everything up.)

Later down the line, I want to upgrade to the RTX 30 series (eyeing up the 3060), so I'll need to upgrade the power supply anyway, I just don't know which wattage I should go for.

For a bit of context, my pc specs are:

I am considering the SSUPD Meshalicious mini ITX case in full mesh. Reasons for this is that it allows me to keep my current graphics card as I don't have to downsize to an ITX, which means I can still keep some of the gaming capabilites of the pc while keeping it in a smaller minimalist case which works well for office use sapce. The case also seems like a good choice for natural heat dispersion because of the mesh as well as modability.

Do any of you have an opinion on the case or anything that should be taken into consideration? 

Here's a link to the case: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.overclockers.co.uk/ssupd-meshlicious-mini-itx-case-full-mesh-black-pcie-3.0-ca-003-su.html%3ftemplate=amp"

buildapc,Help diagnosing a RAID 5 array failure,"Hello! Apologies if this is the wrong community for this, happy to re-post somewhere more appropriate. With that out of the way:

I was given a G Speed Shuttle at work, 32tb in a RAID 5 array, and basically told ""this is broken, make it work again."" My workstation (Mac Pro) can ""see"" the drive thru terminal commands, but can't mount it. My best guess is that one (or more!) of the drives failed and corrupted the thing somehow, as none of the danger indicators (lights, beep codes) have been tripped on the hardware controller. How would you go about diagnosing this problem? My first thought was to get SMART stats from each individual drive to find the culprit, but that information just doesn't show up. Any ideas?"
buildapc,Keep 6800XT or swap for 3080,"I lucked out and got a 3080 10GB from the EVGA queue. I already have a 6800XT , so now I need to figure out whether DLSS is better in the long run compared to having 16B and marginally better raster performance. I don't really care about Ray Tracing, so I'm excluding that factor from consideration for now.

CPU specs: 5600X / 32GB 3600mhz / 1tb SSD

In terms of games, I play fairly demanding things like Tarkov, Far Cry, Hitman, and Control. Ultimately just curious what you all think - is DLSS worth the risk of trading or should I put my hope in FSR or whatever it's called?"
buildapc,Case Fans for my Scenario,"Hey everyone,

I've been researching for a while to replace my noisy RGB fans in my build.  I don't really have a budget, but I want to know I got my money's worth. Obviously, as you probably know, I want some quiet fans, but some that perform well too. Which that probably means no RGB, which isn't a big deal at all (those extra wires and cable management can be a hassle). 

I've been thinking about the Arctic P12's, Phanteks T30's, and Noctua's. To optimize my case fan arrangement, I was thinking about 2x 140mm &amp; 1x 120mm as intake, 1x 120mm in the back as exhaust, and maybe on the top if extra or if needed. I guess I could also do 3x 120mm in the front as well. 

I was wondering, what fans would you choose for my setup &amp; and in what arrangement? I appreciate your help!

&amp;#x200B;

This is a diagram of the Lancool 2 Mesh fan arrangement (please note, like I said above, this case can actually fix 2x 140mm &amp; 1x 120mm in the front as intake): [1dCvjsV.jpg (910×832) (imgur.com)](https://i.imgur.com/1dCvjsV.jpg)"
buildapc,Friend's PC won't boot anymore,"I built this PC for a friend of mine about a year ago. Nothing is super old but most parts were used already when I built it. He told me it just shutoff while internet browsing and now it won't boot at all. No outlet issues, no popping sounds, have tried unplugging and replugging each part (cpu, gpu, etc.) Still nothing. I'm thinking the power supply is probably just dead since the PC isn't getting any power at all, but thought I'd get some advice from the internet people smarter than me.

buildapc,Will 48GB of RAM work?,"This may be a silly question to those more knowledgeable about computers than I, but I'd rather ask a silly question than cause a silly issue with my PC.

So a while back, I upgraded my RAM from Corsair 16GB to T-Force 32GB (both at 3200MHz). The 16GB sticks have just been sitting in my closet for a while, waiting for their time to come once more.

But lately, I've been thinking- can I just add these 16GB sticks back into my computer for that extra RAM? I rarely see RAM configs that stray outside of 8/16/32/64/so-on-so-forth, and that's usually in hardware where it's soldered to the motherboard. But since I have these additional sticks, I could do with the extra RAM for content creation, if that's something that could work."

buildapc,I5 12400 vs I3 12100 in 1080p gaming,"So, I was wondering, since I'm not moving from 1080p anytime soon, am I better off structuring my new build around i3 or the i5.
The gap in price is somewhere near 70-80 dollars, but my current platform is Haswell and I have to go to ddr4 or ddr5 for the lga1700. Finally, my question is, is the i5 12400 worth the extra 70-80 or am I better off investing that in RAM/mobo?"
buildapc,SATA Cable &amp; PSU,"To make a long story short, I'm upgrading a pre-built PC by adding an HDD to it that I already had. I opened it up and attached it to the same SATA the built-in HDD was using. After doing this, I noticed some strange quirks over the past month or so (read past this tl;dr for all the details), is it possible that running a two SATA HDDs and my RGB controls off a single plug could be causing power draw issues or something else quirky?

**Full Details:**

Occasionally the RGB would turn off on everything in the case, including the graphics card. Weird because the only wires on the GPU are the PCI-E cables that go into the PSU. I assumed it was a software issue because so many RGB apps seem buggy.

However, two days ago my GPU was being buggy (monitor turning off, rectangular ""glitchy"" blocks on the screen, and then a BSOD/Restart when I booted up a game while it was doing that.) The day after, the RGB thing happened again but for the first time ever the game I was playing stalled out on me for about 3 - 5 seconds after the RGB turned off and came back (like a power cycle?)

So, I went to take apart the PC, make sure the GPU was seated properly and then I pulled out the PSU just to make sure all the cables were secure. I discovered that the RGB control (I'm kind of clueless on this tbh, but very tiny cables with hard plastic plugs that connect to a hub and all my fancy RGB devices are connected to them, so I assume that's what it is) is plugged into the same SATA alongside both my HDD. So it's running three things (although the Hub kind of daisy chains out to a TON of devices) through a single cable.

**Note:** Funny enough while writing this, the RGB on all the fans turned off, but they didn't turn off on my liquid cooler OR the GPU. So... progress? Maybe???"

buildapc,PSU for NAS build,"Hey everyone

I've got a cooler master elite 110 that I'll be installing my Asrock j4205 in. Planning on using that as a small NAS probably rocking 2 3.5 inch HDDs and a 2.5"" SSD.

What I'm not sure about is the PSU. What should I go for, SFX ? ATX? Electricity is not cheap here so I'm trying to factor that in and also the fact that it'll be running 24/7.

Now, this won't have much load so a fairly small PSU in terms to wattage will probably be enough. Looked into picoPSUs too but not sure how reliable they are with 3 drives. Does anyone have any suggestions? Specific PSUs or guidelines will be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!"
