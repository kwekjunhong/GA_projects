techsupport,Help With Applications Randomly Crashing Blue Screens Intro As the title says ve been struggling to figure out what has been going on with my computer lately It started out almost month ago as some freezing crashing in Skyrim that attributed to conflicting mods Soon though stopped getting error notifications and pop ups and was simply crashing to desktop playing one second then the next looking at the screen as if never booted the game still thought eh just skyrim mods acting up Then it expanded to Mtg Arena crashing to desktop with no error message which figured was some bug of that client as it could sometimes be finicky However searching the MTGA subreddit found almost no one else having problem with the client This lead me to believe that it might be on my end This was around week before Christmas so somewhere around ish don exactly remember when this all started because it was less frequent then and not as pervasive Since that week leading up to Christmas though the problem has only worsening and hitting everywhere get crashes in about anything that do from gaming to FireFox tabs and anything else might use and have even gotten couple of BSODs Sometimes do get error messages more on that later more often don but across everything can find no common thread so not sure what the problem is My guess is hardware but as ve tried troubleshooting more and more

times Unexpected Kernel Mode Trap only once System Service Exception only once See pastebin links at bottom of post for WINDbg transcripts of dmp files x200B Things ve Tried It been bit since started troubleshooting this but ll try to remember everything Uninstalled reinstalled games verified files thru Steam etc Rolled back NVIDIA driver as saw there was new one released on which was right around when this started However rolling back drivers even using DDU to remove everything and do clean install didn fix Tried previous patches to be safe Played games with nvidia overlay turned off Changed settings to maximum performance in nvidia control panel Changed RAM from XMP profile back to default settings went back to XMP enabled after failed to fix Windows Memory Test memtest passed all attempts To be safe eventually even got my hands on new RAM and swapped out to no avail so swapped back to original RAM Unsure if worth noting or not new RAM was exact same model as my current RAM just brand new Formatted hard drive did fresh install of Windows reinstalled all drivers etc as needed Swapped GPU with and played on that for while still crashing Verify windows files through cmd prompt sfc scannow at multiple times throughout this ordeal Checked hard drive health with SMART test through cmd prompt as well as through CrystalDisk snip of screen at bottom of post Flashed BIOS update from version to It worth noting that have had HWInfo on my computer since building it year ago and was always comfortably in healthy temp ranges However since updating bios the summary screen here now isn picking up actual temps but is just defaulting to really low values However since everything in that regard has been fine up until now not particularly worried about this as cause Maybe just something wacky going on with the sensors right now x200B And sure there few more things here and there can recall but that the main portion feel like it not software related as ve formatted reinstalled everything tried multiple versions of my GPU drivers etc So that leaves hardware However ve also tested swapping out RAM swapping out GPU and not getting anything there Tests seem to support nothing wrong with SSD unsure how to test for CPU MOBO PSU issues but from process of elimination that all that really have left Or just as likely there is an issue somewhere else that think ve cleared but in reality just failed to detect and need help finding x200B Conclusion starting to pull my hair out with frustration this is so pervasive affecting any use of the computer from listening to music videos during the day while working due to Firefox crashing to not being able to play any sort of game that isn easily rejoinable due to the application crashes And then whenever the blue screens come around start to get extra scared just built this year ago and reallyyyy don want to be dealing with any crazy problems right now but feel like at the end of the line for easy fixes At this point ve put so much time effort trying to troubleshoot over the past few weeks that even if it is something more dire at least clearly identifying the problem and knowing how to fix it will be such relief even if it costs little money Sorry if this whole post is too lengthy but figured it be better to err on the side of too much info rather than too little million heartfelt thanks to anyone who takes time to help me it is very appreciated x200B Error Logs etc Unfortunately due to the Windows reinstall did on January rd don have any logs of these problems as they were developing just from onward But ll share what have here And keep in mind for every exle shown here there are more that not showing don want to be TOO redundant and for each one of THOSE that not showing there are many many more that didn generate log at all ll crash to desktop go to event viewer and there will just be nothing there at least twice as often as ll go and find log for something x200B Event Viewer Exles multiple images Windows Reliability History Exles multiple images x200B Here are the dmp files that were generated from the blue screens ve gotten after formatting reinstalling windows interpreted via WINDbg Crash dmp file Crash dmp file Crash dmp file Crash dmp file Crash dmp file x200B One of the games that been playing Gunfire Reborn generates its own dmp files in text upon crashing figured it wouldn hurt to capture and share few of those just in case Gunfire Reborn dmp Gunfire Reborn dmp Gunfire Reborn dmp x200B And finally the Crystaldisk Summary mentioned above

techsupport,Games stuttering due to gsync compatibility issues think Hi so have had my gaming monitor for while now the Gigabyte m32q and it has been working perfectly with gsync on my rtx Because it is actually just freesync monitor am using gsync compatibility mode However maybe week or so ago updated my graphics drivers from to and few days later my games started to stutter HARD like maybe frame second or two and the frames were always the same time apart This first happened on watchdogs legion then on halo infinite and then on Cbocw cold war This happened bit in some other games but not as bad however noticed that never had problems with splitgate made sure that my drivers and bios were up to date which did not fix the problem then also checked task manager for my usage and on call of duty cpu and gpu were at and ish respectively when my games were stuttering and then back up to normal usage when it wasnt stuttering All of these games are on an ssd and the disk usage was low When disabled gsync or sometimes when tabbed out then in again it seemed to fix the problem for few minutes but would happen again unless disabled freesync What should do Edit rolled back to the previous driver that had been using with no issues and the same thing was Still happening Maybe it has to do with the fact that updated my chipset drivers but didn update it until AFTER started having these problems not sure if the m32q is listed as gsync compatible but all of the many reviews watched before buying the monitor said that it worked fine with gsync this could all because windows is being crappy should maybe do clean install on windows rn which could also be the issue
