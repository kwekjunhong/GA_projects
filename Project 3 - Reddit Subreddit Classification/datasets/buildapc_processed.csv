buildapc,Lower than expected performance Hey was hoping someone would know the answer to this have bought this cpu now and have owned it for over month have been watching game benchmark videos and have tried the same games on my PC with fps difference This included Watch Dogs Legion which struggled to get past fps When using rivatuner to monitor usage this shows the GPU at use but CPU far higher have did test via GeekBench this morning and both my single and multi core performance are significantly lower than they should be single core and multi core know for certain that this isn an overheating issue as the cooler is well more than capable and the temperatures never exceed degrees under load is there anything you can suggest to try to see why am getting such low level of performance One thing to add is was watching CoreTemp during this and the cpu never passed which seems low considering it peaks at Any way to fix this My RAM as well is exceptionally poor but surely this wouldn have massive knock on to the level it is Or could it be my SSD but everything is mainly on the NVMe one could it be something stupid ve done ie not changed something in BIOS Or do need to unlock power limits in my bios if so how do go about changing the right settings specs Intel core i9 Nvidia RTX ti Corsair TX Psu gb ADATA mhz ram xmp not supported GB ADATA SSD TB SN550 NVME Dark rock pro cooler B560M bazooka mobo Any help or suggestions would be much appreciated
buildapc,would it be better to spend the extra cash on an ssd with dram or dram less ssd but with higher storage all in all Gb is enough really but more storage wouldn hurt Speed isn also my issue since coming from an HDD All really prioritizing is longevity this includes how long the component will last and the warranty they provide for it So you could say that maybe the brand is factor here including their reputation and customer service and also the quality of the product x200B While were at it maybe you could recommend an pcie compatible ssd under bucks but my budget is really just bucks

buildapc,Help With Applications Randomly Crashing Blue Screens Intro As the title says ve been struggling to figure out what has been going on with my computer lately It started out almost month ago as some freezing crashing in Skyrim that attributed to conflicting mods Soon though stopped getting error notifications and pop ups and was simply crashing to desktop playing one second then the next looking at the screen as if never booted the game still thought eh just skyrim mods acting up Then it expanded to Mtg Arena crashing to desktop with no error message which figured was some bug of that client as it could sometimes be finicky However searching the MTGA subreddit found almost no one else having problem with the client This lead me to believe that it might be on my end This was around week before Christmas so somewhere around ish don exactly remember when this all started because it was less frequent then and not as pervasive Since that week leading up to Christmas though the problem has only worsening and hitting everywhere get crashes in about anything that do from gaming to FireFox tabs and anything else might use and have even gotten couple of BSODs Sometimes do get error messages more on that later more often don but across everything can find no common thread so not sure what the problem is My guess is hardware but as ve tried troubleshooting more and more without success my google searches have started turning up the same results and the well seems to be running dry So posting this in hopes of finding something useful specific to my situation sure the answer is out there somewhere but too dense to connect the dots and put it all together so appreciate anyone else help getting me there x200B Specs built this computer bit over year ago now and have had absolutely no issues up until now There are couple extra fans etc in there but this is the core of the build CPU AMD Ryzen GHz Core Processor MOBO ASRock B550 Pro4 ATX AM4 Motherboard Memory Corsair Vengeance LPX GB GB DDR4 CL16 Memory Storage Samsung EVO Plus TB NVME Solid State Drive GPU NVIDIA GeForce RTX GB Founders Edition Video Card PSU EVGA SuperNOVA GA Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply Case Fractal Design Meshify ATX Mid Tower Case x200B Issues ve Encountered Applications crash to desktop with no error message very common Sometimes can happen within five minutes of starting game sometimes can go an hour or two without problem Seems very random however has definitely been increasing in regularity as time goes on x200B Firefox tabs randomly crashing Browser itself stays up but individual tab will have something went wrong message x200B Games crashing with an accompanying Event Viewer log Very often mention problem with Unity dll sometimes with ntdll dll xul dll etc Didn start occurring until after week or two of the crashes See pastebin links at bottom of post for Event Viewer transcripts x200B Blue Screens of Death Messages ve gotten include IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL several times Unexpected Kernel Mode Trap only once System Service Exception only once See pastebin links at bottom of post for WINDbg transcripts of dmp files x200B Things ve Tried It been bit since started troubleshooting this but ll try to remember everything Uninstalled reinstalled games verified files thru Steam etc Rolled back NVIDIA driver as saw there was new one released on which was right around when this started However rolling back drivers even using DDU to remove everything and do clean install didn fix Tried previous patches to be safe Played games with nvidia overlay turned off Changed settings to maximum performance in nvidia control panel Changed RAM from XMP profile back to default settings went back to XMP enabled after failed to fix Windows Memory Test memtest passed all attempts To be safe eventually even got my hands on new RAM and swapped out to no avail so swapped back to original RAM Unsure if worth noting or not new RAM was exact same model as my current RAM just brand new Formatted hard drive did fresh install of Windows reinstalled all drivers etc as needed Swapped GPU with and played on that for while still crashing Verify windows files through cmd prompt sfc scannow at multiple times throughout this ordeal Checked hard drive health with SMART test through cmd prompt as well as through CrystalDisk snip of screen at bottom of post Flashed BIOS update from version to It worth noting that have had HWInfo on my computer since building it year ago and was always comfortably in healthy temp ranges However since updating bios the summary screen here now isn picking up actual temps but is just defaulting to really low values However since everything in that regard has been fine up until now not particularly worried about this as cause Maybe just something wacky going on with the sensors right now x200B And sure there few more things here and there can recall but that the main portion feel like it not software related as ve formatted reinstalled everything tried multiple versions of my GPU drivers etc So that leaves hardware However ve also tested swapping out RAM swapping out GPU and not getting anything there Tests seem to support nothing wrong with SSD unsure how to test for CPU MOBO PSU issues but from process of elimination that all that really have left Or just as likely there is an issue somewhere else that think ve cleared but in reality just failed to detect and need help finding x200B Conclusion starting to pull my hair out with frustration this is so pervasive affecting any use of the computer from listening to music videos during the day while working due to Firefox crashing to not being able to play any sort of game that isn easily rejoinable due to the application crashes And then whenever the blue screens come around start to get extra scared just built this year ago and reallyyyy don want to be dealing with any crazy problems right now but feel like at the end of the line for easy fixes At this point ve put so much time effort trying to troubleshoot over the past few weeks that even if it is something more dire at least clearly identifying the problem and knowing how to fix it will be such relief even if it costs little money Sorry if this whole post is too lengthy but figured it be better to err on the side of too much info rather than too little million heartfelt thanks to anyone who takes time to help me it is very appreciated x200B Error Logs etc Unfortunately due to the Windows reinstall did on January rd don have any logs of these problems as they were developing just from onward But ll share what have here And keep in mind for every exle shown here there are more that not showing don want to be TOO redundant and for each one of THOSE that not showing there are many many more that didn generate log at all ll crash to desktop go to event viewer and there will just be nothing there at least twice as often as ll go and find log for something x200B Event Viewer Exles multiple images Windows Reliability History Exles multiple images x200B Here are the dmp files that were generated from the blue screens ve gotten after formatting reinstalling windows interpreted via WINDbg Crash dmp file Crash dmp file Crash dmp file Crash dmp file Crash dmp file x200B One of the games that been playing Gunfire Reborn generates its own dmp files in text upon crashing figured it wouldn hurt to capture and share few of those just in case Gunfire Reborn dmp Gunfire Reborn dmp Gunfire Reborn dmp x200B And finally the Crystaldisk Summary mentioned above CrystalDisk Summary x200B Again sincere thank you to any all help given appreciate it beyond words

buildapc,Random shutdowns with no BSOD error logs or codes or any warning Hi struggled to figure where to post this since well not building PC but know that most people here are smarter than me so it worth shot Specs EVGA GTX gb Ryzen gb of Corsair Vengeance mhz x8 ASUS Prime Plus Cooler Master PSU Gold rated gb NVME Samsung Evo Plus OS Drive tb WD drive don know the specifics its an old drive Windows For the past month or so my pc built in has randomly shutdown with zero warning and no error message code log and no BSOD It is random but can be recreated suspect it may possibly be VRAM issue of some sort because can recreate the shutdown by opening different games that max the VRAM notably deathloop if open deathloop it goes to the menu and checking task manager the VRAM spikes to nearly gb of usage then shortly after the whole system shuts down exactly like the random shutdowns This happens in other games randomly as well KSP launches and may play it for hours then it will unexpectedly shutdown Minecraft showed similar results as KSP wouldn be so confused or stumped if it just happened playing games would still be somewhat confused but probably be more dismissive because it was likely me running out of VRAM but it also happens extremely randomly with patterns One time opened Ableton Live and around minutes in everything shutdown Another time had turned on my pc not even logged in and left to grab drink When came back the PC had shutdown It even happened before windows had booted pressed the power button and then before the loading screen came on it shutdown My wallpaper also bugs out frequently It either turns black after showing the wallpaper for few minutes or if drag my mouse with the selection box it creates black spots in the shape and size of the selection box so far have only run memory tests which showed no errors checked the windows logs and whenever it shutdown the only error was an unexpected shutdown event ve reinstalled windows already and the problem persisted suspect it could probably also be the PSU when plug in USB cable and into specific wireless charger it only that specific brand model have and both cause the problem it shuts down but if plug my Quest into it it doesn shutdown am genuinely stumped as to what this issue could be

buildapc,is it safe to plug in my pin rgb cable from my cooler to the led header on my motherboard have cooler master ml240l argb and it comes with two different rgb cables one of them is notched three pin labeled asrock asus msi while the other one is non notched three pin labeled gigabyte the cooler came with its own controller and it works fine but would like the ability to change the colors and the only possible way to do that is using rgb fusion my first question is which rgb cable should use have gigabyte motherboard and currently the one labled asrock asus msi is plugged into the controller my second question is which header do plug the cable into have pin and pin led headers on my gigabyte z690 gaming motherboard LED1 LED2 LED C1 LED C2 am even supposed to plug my argb cooler into led header my motherboard doesn seem to have rgb header maybe supposed to plug it into fan header have three unused fan headers ve heard that doing this wrong can fry motherboard due to different voltages so just want to make sure which cable use and if can actually plug in the rgb cables into led headers since don have rgb headers thanks
buildapc,Motherboard decision Gigabyte or MSI at crossroads with regards to my new system PCPP The Gigabyte Z690 UD DDR4 has been out of stock ever since can remember while the MSI PRO Z690 DDR4 is almost always in stock don mind waiting at all am very patient person and wasn planning on building the system until February anyways but since was finally able to buy my case at decent price now it feels like the time has come much sooner My current system does have Gigabyte board in it H270 Gaming and while like it can help but be irked by what are apparently some shoddy RGB elements in it have the RGB elements of my case Phanteks Eclipse P400 connected to the board and it seems as though the board cannot output Red color signal at all to the case lights The RGB lights on the board itself seem to be divided over what can glow Red and what cannot almost like the Red signal is being shorted out somewhere on the board This seems to be purely cosmetic thing and the system has never ever given me BSOD in the years ve had it so inclined not to let this be reason why should never buy from Gigabyte again but it does make me question if should go another way ve never built system with an MSI board before but just can shake this notion in my head that they are somehow lesser brand Maybe that was true in the past and just need to update my thinking but note the MSI board going for about more than the Gigabyte and have to wonder if there is really some added value to it In comparing the two boards really not seeing lot of major differences MSI has an extra M2 slot at the cost of two PCI x1 slots and perhaps better positioned pump fan header but that about it All Gigabyte can boast about is maybe that extra RGB header at the top of the board It not really moving the needle in big way either direction for me Am overthinking this What would your choice be between the two

buildapc,its my old PC worth upgrading or better to build from scratch specs in comment Hello was thinking of building new PC from scratch but was thinking if maybe is better to try to upgrade the current PC have besides itbeing like cheaper option there is also the fact that have never built PC from scratch and sometimes worry that might damage something while building it specially the most fragile components like the cpu or other stuff like that other option was to just pay the computer store to assembly it however am still debating if maybe just upgrading my current PC is better option these are my current PC specs CPU Intel Core i5 GHz RAM GB Dual Channel DDR3 MHz GPU Asus MB NVIDIA GeForce GT motherboard ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC H81M SOCKET dont know which exactly is my PSU this is previous thread made where showed image of the PSU and was told it was around watts can know the watts of my psu as mentioned in that thread was recommended to change the PSU if wanted to upgrade to better graphics card also dont know what model the case is its older one with the PSU on the upside so wanted to know if maybe this current Pc is worth keeping and to just upgraded some components especially things like the cpu was thinking on upgrading the PSU and GPU maybe adding another extra ssd currently have recent tb ssd and older gb hhd that plan on keeping both but dont know if maybe it would be up to par to more incoming games right now it struggles to games even from like also use my PC for modelling and rendering or just the fact of being old hardware remenber googling if the ddr3 ram stick could be used on newer motherboard that use the ddr4 and read that it cant and that the ddr3 are aprently old technology now so was thinking if maybe building new from scratch to just not stay so behind since obviously plan on upgrading it further so that made me think if is better to just build new PC from scratch and them just add the ssd and hdd and maybe the dvd drive dont know what other component from the old PC to add or if am recomeneded to upgrade allmost all parts them just best to make whole new pc build so what can be best option to upgrade this PC or build one from scratch also any recomendation to avoid damaging the components while building would be apreciated dont know if maybe its better to make separate thread for that thanks in advance

buildapc,Which th gen Intel chip Discussion First of all there are the Celerons cores threads and the Pentiums cores threads In most cases they won be worth buying in that the performance is low enough that you just buy used PC or an older gen with cheaper motherboard costs The i3 has three models I3 no GPU GHz Will give good gaming performance with discrete GPU I3 ditto but with EU GPU built in that the same as gen Intel which was improved by about from the th gen but still much worse than Ryzen let alone discrete GPU I3 GHz gets you an extra MHz peak which is pretty bad deal I5 Now an i5 you get MB cache instead of MB and cores rather than This is worth the extra money even though clock speeds aren improved I5 bucks gets you working IGP that the same as the cheaper ones I5 another MHz or and also slightly better GPU that is in terms of graphics cores rather than This means the GPUs in the th gen are the same as the corresponding th gen except the clock speed has been bumped by The EU is NOT faster than the because the stays the same but it worth about over the For more you can argue with the value of this chip The i5 has another MHz CPU max for more There no more GPU bump available this one tends to come up against the i5 on value But it depends on actual real prices in the market The i5 is different CPU in that it contains not cores but The are low speed cores so you can use for gaming for streaming say In addition as chip this CPU is unlocked for full overclocking To do this will require Z690 motherboard but you can get extra performance on cheaper CPUs by unlocking power limits the actual overclocking potential is less significant than the extra cores here The i5 kf is as ever cheaper than the being missing the GPU The i7 gets you big cores and little There no gaming performance improvement in most games For specific tasks such as rendering the extra more cores is worth it There is basic price premium of the series over the series of HOWEVER the are merely locked versions of the saving you whereas the saved on the over the kf buys you smaller chip with the little cores missing The i9 chips are the same story as the i7s locked and GPUless versions of the same thing Here the only difference from the i7 is Mb more cache and more little cores The price premium is over the i7 for the locked chip which widens to for unlocked There is improved performance for specific threaded tasks such as rendering and compiling but for those jobs the i7 adds more for less money relative to the i5 than the i9 does over the i5 For me it unfortunate that there not locked i5 with the cores for users not wanting to overclock This does mean that the is an interesting upsell to the kf note the current retail prices in my country Indonesia kf There are obviously therefore logical product types and the step from i5k to i7 is the best value of all of them from purely mathematical perspective albeit YOUR workload might not benefit

buildapc,Some advice appreciated Looking to upgrade my gpu real soon Last week finally made the decision to slowly upgrade my pc to something little bit more powerful by today standards For the past years or so was rocking gtx gb i7 Asus Z97 and x8gb ram And color me impressed they were handling quite well the demand but last year the new releases were putting quite the toll on them So figured is the year for me to upgrade terrible year for that reckon Started by updrading to DDR4 about time Got myself really good deal with Ryzen Asus b450m gaming motherboard and whole new pair of gb ram mhz Felt the difference with some games straight away especially of those more CPU intesive Overall very satisfied But now for the tricky one GPU Prices are needless to say absurd Guess there no such thing as entry level card nowadays lol But looking at my modest budget and proper upgrade that could handle at least some years was aiming for either RTX RTX TI or go team red something ve never done for GPU and try my luck with RX XT My question basically is what do you guys think considering might wait possibly till half of to upgrade my GPU and praying that prices might lower bit what the best cost benefit gpu on the market that could last at least years Cheers

buildapc,Another series post Are you in the hold or the bite the bullet now one Friend and were having conversation about this yesterday as was preparing to bite the bullet on new in box FTW3 For reference he and both have Strix ti in our builds currently With the series supposedly coming this year even if late does it make sense to hold out for that round of cards and pay inflated prices then as opposed to now when the series is on deck to be supplanted My school of thought was this going to get gouged on new card so what the point in waiting another year Especially given that not sure anyone really knows when the series will launch and from there how long it will take for used or flipped stock to hit the market His school of thought was essentially going to get gouged on new card so might as well wait to get ultra gouged on series once that launches because at least that way ll max out my total performance improvement over my current card at the same but potentially more inflated cost over MSRP still on the fence but to be honest his thinking makes more sense to me in the long run If you re going to pay over MSRP wouldn you want to wait until you can get whatever card will stretch that out over the longest possible time series at flipped pricing once those launch don see the market getting any better in the next year or two but that doesn mean card performance will stall by any means Where are other people standing on this

buildapc,have motherboard from the early days of implementation have questions about compatibility and practicality If it supports PCIe does that mean NVMe drives will work is hard to find can connect with an adapter Will get appreciably better performance over SATA SSD So have an ASUS Maximus VI extreme which launched circa As result it basically barely sneaked in compatibility but its done through proprietary adapter the mPCIe Combo II From what understand this is plug in adapter that supports PCIe and SATA Gb So my questions are It specifies form factor but this is hard to find expensive Could buy and connect it through an adapter or cable Would this degrade performance or otherwise be inadvisable If it supports PCIe does that also mean it supports NVMe Sorry if this is silly question but ve found that is just the port and can be used for NVMe or SATA The manual never specifies support for NVMe and not sure if support for PCIe is the same thing or not Given the above info is there any reason could expect buying to not be worth it over just SSD Like if the compatible is more money than its worth or if it doesn support NVMe and would be SATA anyway and the form factor would get better value for money Any other things to look for when buying If can adapt it will any decent modern NVMe be compatible

buildapc,Tips and Questions on Upgrading an Older Gaming PC Hey all new to the PC building scene Got donated an old gaming computer from my dad that he built back some time between and it the first actual gaming PC ve ever had looking to upgrade some of the components now that it been over decade and have some questions want to make it gaming streaming work PC engineering work so CAD and simulation programs that can be pretty graphically and computationally intensive Here are the current specs on it Motherboard EVGA X58 SLI supports threeway SLI with PCIe slots supporting total lanes X16 X16 X8 X8 GPU Nvidia GTX have three of them can work with currently only has one in the PCIe X16 slot CPU Intel i7 Corsair watercooler Memory x2 GB Corsair Dominator GT DDR3 PC3 originally had two of them broke somehow long ago so it has two empty slots supports interleaving Hard Drive OS is on GB OCZ RevoDrive X2 PCIe SSD in the X8 slot and GB Samsung EVO SSD for storage hooked to the motherboard Power Supply PC Power Cooling Turbo Cool looking to upgrade the memory hard drives and GPU want to run two GTX in SLI in the X16 and X16 X8 slots so it can for the time being at least keep up with streaming more recent games at decent fps without sacrificing graphics too much Not looking to buy newer GPUs for now as the market and my wallet do not agree with each other With this configuration should be able to achieve that as well as easily render any complex assemblies need to do in CAD SLI might be bit outdated but it is what it is For the memory love to fill it back up with another set of x2 GB DDR3 sticks but cannot find them for reasonable price ll have to downgrade to DDR3 or to fill them all back up again rather have GB at than leave it at GB at The motherboard only supports GB of RAM so that why not just going for GB and calling it there also supposedly filling up all the RAM slots should maximize their capability with interleaving still trying to figure that out though For hard drives want to run two new TB Samsung EVO SSDs in RAID with an X8 SATA III PCIe RAID controller to maximize read write speeds and update the capabilities from SATA II and allow for future possibilities of running RAID etc configurations for backup as data corruption could be very costly with work tl dr upgrading the memory from GB to GB hard drives from GB to TB SATA III in RAID and GPU to two GTX with SLI Some questions had Will running an X1 X2 or X4 PCIe RAID Controller in the third X8 PCIe slot with the two GPUs in the X16 and X16 X8 slots impact their performance in any way And will running lower than X8 RAID controller slow down its own reading writing speed Similar question if were to put an X8 RAID controller in the X8 slot then technically one GPU would be at X16 and the other at X8 at least according to the motherboard manual for how the lanes are split for way SLI GPUs Is that correct or am missing something If it is correct how would SFR or AFR handle with the GPUs operating with differing numbers of lanes like would one be lagging more than the other causing potential stuttering or frame drops Or is it just not possible that way and both GPUs would need to run at X8 somehow Is there anything specific should be looking for for the new RAM to make sure they can support interleaving or is that handled on the motherboard side ask because really struggling to find anything more about interleaving online besides explanations of what it is Lastly any suggestions or comments Anything else should try to upgrade that may cause bottlenecks in the upgrades want to add The only two things don want to touch right now are the motherboard and GPUs those can be future things when price is less of an object really excited to learn so anything is appreciated

buildapc,SATA Cable PSU To make long story short upgrading pre built PC by adding an HDD to it that already had opened it up and attached it to the same SATA the built in HDD was using After doing this noticed some strange quirks over the past month or so read past this tl dr for all the details is it possible that running two SATA HDDs and my RGB controls off single plug could be causing power draw issues or something else quirky Full Details Occasionally the RGB would turn off on everything in the case including the graphics card Weird because the only wires on the GPU are the PCI cables that go into the PSU assumed it was software issue because so many RGB apps seem buggy However two days ago my GPU was being buggy monitor turning off rectangular glitchy blocks on the screen and then BSOD Restart when booted up game while it was doing that The day after the RGB thing happened again but for the first time ever the game was playing stalled out on me for about seconds after the RGB turned off and came back like power cycle So went to take apart the PC make sure the GPU was seated properly and then pulled out the PSU just to make sure all the cables were secure discovered that the RGB control kind of clueless on this tbh but very tiny cables with hard plastic plugs that connect to hub and all my fancy RGB devices are connected to them so assume that what it is is plugged into the same SATA alongside both my HDD So it running three things although the Hub kind of daisy chains out to TON of devices through single cable Note Funny enough while writing this the RGB on all the fans turned off but they didn turn off on my liquid cooler OR the GPU So progress Maybe
