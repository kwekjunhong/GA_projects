techsupport,Win 11 dwm.exe is using way too much vram,"I have been on Win 11 since the beta, in October when it released a bit after I uploaded to a RTX 3070, dwm.exe started using up to 34 GB of vram which doesn't even make sense, the 3070 has 8GB of vram. I tried playing Doom Eternal while it was at 34 GB and the game ran at like 10 fps even with low textures. I tried finding a fix and coudn't so I resorted to ending the dwm.exe task so it would restart fixing it temporarily until it slowly started to rise again within a few hours. Today when I started my PC I went to go play Doom Eternal, and had performce issues so I went into task manager, it was using 4 GB so I just restarted it like usual, now the problem is it's always at like 1.5 GB of Vram usage even after restarting my PC multiple times and even after updating my Nvidia drivers to the newer ones that I purposely was avoiding since it makes my TV unusable at 120hz by causing flickering even that didn't fix it. This is a pretty big problem since at 4k the 3070 can barely squeeze by with 8GB free as it is. I haven't been able to find a fix for this and it's annoying me so much that I'm honestly considering doing a fresh Win 10 install or ditching Windows entirely. If anyone has a fix for this I would be incredibly thankful."
techsupport,Toshiba Qosmio X70B10T graphics card not detected anywhere.,"I recently had this laptop formated and I just realized that my normal graphics card , which was AMD R9 M200X, had been replaced by my processor graphics (IntelR HD graphics 4600).

techsupport,How to find original MD5 Hash,"Hello, I am trying to determine if a file I have downloaded has been tampered with BEFORE downloading it.

techsupport,Need to find the power button / LED pin layout on a HP Z240 workstation.,"So I can get a computer from work to take to home. I found one HP Z240 Tower workstation with Inter Xeon in it and I was thinking of checking a bit more of it by booting it up, and eventually turn it into a gaming rig (of sorts). Well it does not boot, but I noticed that the front powerbutton is not connected to the motherboard. As in, someone has severed the wires entirely.

I was thinking that I would just short the two power button pins with something and try to boot using that, but I can't find *anything* regarding the pin layout on the internet. 

So I came here. Any ideas? I feel like it is not a good idea to start shorting random pins...

techsupport,Asus laptop microphone picking up noise but not recording it,"Hi - I have an asus notebook laptop (so Windows 10) with an in-built microphone described as Microphone Array (Intel Smart Sound Technology for Digital Microphones). Yesterday evening in a Zoom meeting it just didn't work at all and I had to leave the meeting. The microphone is still listed in the drivers, so the laptop knows it's there.

The weirder thing is that it is detecting the sound, but it can't seem to record the sound. When I go into sound settings, the ""Test your microphone bar"" moves with the sounds I make, but every other app (Zoom, voice recorder, WhatsApp, etc.) cannot actually record the noises. The little microphone icon in the bottom bar even appears when the apps are being used. Here is a list of everything I've tried that has not worked:

* Restarting everything
* Uninstalling and reinstalling Zoom
* Checking for updated drivers
* Troubleshooting sound recording
* Uninstalling the Windows update I installed the previous evening

None of this has worked. Any help or suggestions would be massively appreciated."

techsupport,S20 FE Touchscreen issues when keyboard is open,"Hello guys,
i have a Problem with my Samsung galaxy S20 FE for a few months now. The Phone in general works great, but when the keyboard is opened, it kind of slows down touch-recognition. If i swipe across the screen, the Phone recognizes a lot of singular taps instead of one long tap. This problem leads to a lot of issues. For example i cant really make audio mesages on whatsapp (which is not that bad of a problem to be honest). I also made some accidental calls. This problem seems to be a software problem, because if the keyboard isnt opened, the touchscreen works great. I also looked up some forums with other user experiencing the same problem.

techsupport,Windows randomly freezing,"Hello,

For a year now I've been experiencing a problem where Windows would randomly freeze. I can still move the mouse, occasionally open folders but Task Manager is frozen when opened and it stays that way until I force restart.

Another thing of note is that I see the HDD LED light turn off when this happens. I've noticed the frequency of it lessens when I turn hardware acceleration off on my browser and Discord, but Windows freezes almost on a daily basis regardless. 

The most frequent occurrence is when I'm drawing (Clip Studio Paint) or working in 3D (Blender). Some posts I've seen pointed that it might be a faulty SSD but I'm not sure anymore. Anyone have anything similar happen?"

techsupport,Desktop Black Screen And Unsure How To Fix It,"So to preface, I had restarted my computer for a windows update. The update was finishing up, and I got stuck on the 100% mark for ten to twelve minutes so I thought that progress had frozen. I shut the computer down, but after restarting it the desktop remains blank. If I try to restart windows explorer it just disappears until I go to task manager, and run a random folder. However the desktop still doesn't show up.

I ran the SFC command, but it showed no integrity issues. Windows settings (and everything else in it) seemingly doesn't exist. The internet still works, and the sound still works. I just can't get to anything in the settings app on windows. I can access things like control panel, and anything that uses a file explorer. I can still run programs as long as I'm running them through the task manager. 

Windows hotkey combinations don't work either (obviously since there's no start bar). So I'm just confused on how to approach this, and what to do to fix it."

techsupport,NVIDIA Surround / PhysX 3x monitors 144hz,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly I hope I am in the correct section and thanks in advance for your help.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently picked up a new 3rd monitor in the sales and am having major issues getting my 3 monitors to run at 144Hz using NVIDIA Surround to combine the 3 into 1. I have 3 27 inch ""gaming"" monitors with G-Sync compatibility, 2 are LG 27GL850, and 1 is a DELL 2721DGF (brand new) all are connected to a 2080 RTX via each DP,  All three monitors run 2560x1440 at 144Hz individually when NVIDIA Surround is not used. 

However, 7680x1440@60Hz is the only available option to select in NVIDIA Surround. 60hz works for the OS and games, however, 144Hz is why I bought the monitors, to begin with so I would really like to get that working. 

&amp;#x200B;

These monitors all have the same panel LG-made panel so I was expecting the setup of NVIDIA Surround for 144Hz gaming to be relatively straightforward (how wrong I was).  Quite simply the LG+DELL combination in NVIDIA Surround does not have a selectable option for 144Hz. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed (497.29). OS is WIn10 (with latest updates). All monitors have the latest available stable firmware.

&amp;#x200B;

I have read the guide and tried using cru (version 1.5.1) to edit the settings, however, so far have been completely unable to get 7680x1440@144Hz working. Any changes made in cru only seem to lower the combined resolution displayed and or mess up the spanned display across the monitors. 

&amp;#x200B;

My feeling on this is that the timing of the DELL which appears to be an exact refresh rate of  143.912Hz rather than 144Hz which is conflicting with LG's @ 144Hz somehow, although this is the first time I've had 3 monitors and subsequently used cru.  

&amp;#x200B;

Note: All three monitors are able to run at 165Hz with the option selectable on the DELL monitor settings via the buttons and via overclock on the LG's so 144Hz shouldn't be an issue.  (I have not OC'd the monitors though).   

If anyone is able to help out with known working/ recommended settings for the mentioned 27 inch 144Hz monitors using NVIDIA Surround (with or without cru), please let me know.. 

Also if this is not the best place to ask, please point me in the right direction.

Thank you!!"

Can I just create a domain alias and continue to receive email from my old address, as long as I still own the old domain? The Google support website is confusing.

techsupport,What's wrong with my Ipad's storage,"Hello,

So getting to the point my iPad has been having issues with its storage and I think I know what may have caused it but I'm not sure what to do to fix it.

When my nephew had online classes in 2020 my sister (his mother) asked me to record his class and so I filmed his class with my ipad. But after a few minutes it stopped filiming and after my sister didn't need the video anymore I deleted it but since then I noticed more storage issues than before. But it was minor back then but now its much more noticeable

I got it during the late summer of 2020. It has 32gbs and I used it primary for online classes and drawing and even after I deleted the video it seemed fine until this last November. 

When I start seeing notifications that storage is nearly filled I got rid of the only game I had. Then I got rid of any apps I don't use anymore.

Now i only have the apps that I use on a daily and yet there is still storage issues. In the settings it shows a significant portion is in 'other' data. 

I don't know what's causing my ipad to have these issues and what I find ridiculous is that at the same time i got my ipad I also got one for my sister that is the exact same that she and her son uses, and he has downloaded tons of games and such but they don't seem to have any issues. I don't really know what to do. 

As mentioned I used two drawing apps and my ipad ia the only apple product I have so I'm not sure if I can back it up on anything else. Nothing I try to do seems to work. The only apps I use are patreon, ibis paint x, procreate, Instagram that I just deleted and I used to have PayPal but got rid of that too. 

Yet my ipad storage is still at 31.2 gbs. I don't know what to do. Any advice?"

techsupport,Help With Applications Randomly Crashing &amp; Blue Screens,"**Intro**

As the title says, I've been struggling to figure out what has been going on with my computer lately.  It started out almost a month ago as some freezing/crashing in Skyrim that I attributed to conflicting mods.  Soon, though, I stopped getting error notifications and pop-ups, and was simply crashing to desktop - playing one second, then the next looking at the screen as if I'd never booted the game.  I still thought ""eh, just skyrim mods acting up.""

Then, it expanded to Mtg:Arena crashing to desktop with no error message, which I figured was some bug of that client as it could sometimes be finicky.  However, searching the MTGA subreddit, I found almost no one else having a problem with the client.  This lead me to believe that it might be on my end.  This was around a week before Christmas, so somewhere around 12/18/21-12/20/21...ish.  I don't exactly remember when this all started, because it was less frequent then and not as pervasive.

Since that week leading up to Christmas, though, the problem has only worsening and hitting everywhere.  I get crashes in about anything that I do - from gaming, to FireFox tabs, and anything else I might use - and have even gotten a couple of BSODs.  Sometimes I do get error messages (more on that later), more often I don't, but across everything I can find no common thread so I'm not sure what the problem is.  

My guess is hardware, but as I've tried troubleshooting more and more without success, my google searches have started turning up the same results and the well seems to be running dry.  So I'm posting this in hopes of finding something useful specific to my situation.  I'm sure the answer is out there somewhere, but I'm too dense to connect the dots and put it all together, so I'd appreciate anyone else's help getting me there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Specs**

I built this computer a bit over a year ago now, and have had absolutely no issues up until now.  There are a couple extra fans etc in there, but this is the core of the build:

CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600x 3.8 GHz 6-Core Processor

MOBO: ASRock B550 Pro4 ATX AM4 Motherboard

Memory: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory

Storage: Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive

GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 8GB Founders Edition Video Card

PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA GA 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply

Case: Fractal Design Meshify C ATX Mid Tower Case

&amp;#x200B;

**Issues I've Encountered**

\-Applications crash to desktop with no error message (very common)

	\-Sometimes can happen within five minutes of starting a game, sometimes can go an hour or two without a problem.  Seems very random, however has definitely been increasing in regularity as time goes on.

\-Firefox tabs randomly crashing

	\-Browser itself stays up, but individual tab will have a ""something went wrong"" message

\-Games crashing with an accompanying Event Viewer log

	\-Very often mention a problem with Unity.dll, sometimes with ntdll.dll / xul.dll / etc.

	\-Didn't start occurring until after a week or two of the crashes

	\-See pastebin links at bottom of post for Event Viewer transcripts

\-Blue Screens of Death.  Messages I've gotten include: 

	\-IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL (several times)

	\-Unexpected\_Kernel\_Mode\_Trap (only once)

	\-System\_Service\_Exception (only once)

	\-See pastebin links at bottom of post for WINDbg transcripts of .dmp files

&amp;#x200B;

**Things I've Tried**

It's been a bit since I started troubleshooting this, but I'll try to remember everything...

\-Uninstalled &amp; reinstalled games, verified files thru Steam, etc.

\-Rolled back NVIDIA driver, as I saw there was a new one released on 12/20/21, which was right around when this started.  However, rolling back drivers (even using DDU to remove everything and do a clean install) didn't fix.  Tried previous 2 patches to be safe.

\-Played games with nvidia overlay turned off

\-Changed 3D settings to ""maximum performance"" in nvidia control panel

\-Changed RAM from XMP profile back to default settings; went back to XMP-enabled after failed to fix

\-Windows Memory Test &amp; memtest, passed all attempts.  To be safe, eventually even got my hands on new RAM and swapped out to no avail, so swapped back to original RAM \[Unsure if worth noting or not, new RAM was exact same model as my current RAM, just brand new.\]

\-Formatted hard drive &amp; did a fresh install of Windows. \[reinstalled all drivers etc as needed\]

\-Swapped GPU with a 3060 and played on that for a while, still crashing

\-Verify windows files through cmd prompt 'sfc /scannow' at multiple times throughout this ordeal.

\-Checked hard drive health with SMART test through cmd prompt, as well as through CrystalDisk (snip of screen at bottom of post)

\-Flashed BIOS update from version 1.2 to 2.1

	\-It's worth noting that I have had HWInfo on my computer since building it a year ago, and was always comfortably in healthy temp ranges.  However, since updating bios, the summary screen here now isn't picking up actual temps but is just defaulting to really low values.  However, since everything in that regard has been fine up until now, I'm not particularly worried about this as a cause.  Maybe just something wacky going on with the sensors right now.

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm sure there's a few more things here and there I can't recall, but that's the main portion.  I feel like it's not software related as I've formatted &amp; reinstalled everything, tried multiple versions of my GPU drivers, etc.  So that leaves hardware.  However, I've also tested swapping out RAM, swapping out GPU, and not getting anything there.  Tests seem to support nothing wrong with SSD.  

I'm unsure how to test for CPU/MOBO/PSU issues, but from process of elimination that's all that I really have left.  (Or, just as likely, there is an issue somewhere else that I think I've cleared but in reality just failed to detect and need help finding.)  

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I'm starting to pull my hair out with frustration b/c this is so pervasive, affecting any use of the computer from listening to music/videos during the day while working due to Firefox crashing, to not being able to play any sort of game that isn't easily rejoinable due to the application crashes.  And then whenever the blue screens come around I start to get extra scared.  

I just built this a year ago and reallyyyy don't want to be dealing with any crazy problems right now, but feel like I'm at the end of the line for ""easy"" fixes.  At this point, I've put so much time &amp; effort trying to troubleshoot over the past few weeks that even if it is something more dire, at least clearly identifying the problem and knowing how to fix it will be such a relief, even if it costs a little money.

Sorry if this whole post is too lengthy, but I figured it'd be better to err on the side of too much info rather than too little.  A million heartfelt thanks to anyone who takes time to help me; it is very appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Error Logs, etc**

Unfortunately, due to the Windows reinstall I did on January 3rd, I don't have any logs of these problems as they were developing; just from 1/3/22 onward.  But I'll share what I have here.  And keep in mind, for every example shown here, there are more that I'm not showing b/c I don't want to be TOO redundant; and for each one of THOSE that I'm not showing, there are many, many more that didn't generate a log at all.  I'll crash to desktop, go to event viewer, and there will just be nothing there at least twice as often as I'll go and find a log for something.

To anyone who sees this and replies, I do thank you in advance for any helpful tips and reading this whole message, I can post my email as well for any follow ups.

I believe I have tried almost everything to get this issue to stop, it first happened two days ago while playing APEX, all of a sudden mid game the screen turned black and I was told my monitor had no input device, I quickly forced shut down my pc and started it back up and I thought everything was fine, and the issue happened again minutes later. I then tried a HDMI cable instead of my DP (Display port) and still had the same issue, it would black out at random times, it would happen faster once I started a video game up.

I then noticed that my display adapter driver, I'll say DAD for short, was disabled and my display resolution in System &gt; Display was grayed out and in the Advanced display settings there was no option for refresh rate where there should be. I then uninstalled my DAD using the program DDU in safemode to remove the drivers properly and reinstalled afterwards, which fixed the minor issues that I just listed above. I then updated the DAD to the latest version Adrenalin 22.1.1 1/11/2022. That didn't help with anything and the screen would black out and I had to force shut down my pc every time it happened and when I started it back up the DAD was disabled again and the screen resolution was locked as well.

After further research I cleaned both my ram sticks as well as my gpu, no help. I thought it may have been a BIOS issue so I updated that properly but still nothing. My second to last resort was to factory reset my pc and that still didn't help, my last resort is to buy a new gpu which I’ve seen a few people online say it worked for them.

Once again thank you for your time.

techsupport,"Repeated BSoD over several months, ntoskrnl.exe crashing","So, as per the title, I've had this issue for quite a while now. Sometimes it seems like it's been solved but then it eventually crops up again later.

I can't even remember when it originally started, but I'll get pretty frequent BSoD errors to the tune of usually multiple per week (if not per day, sometimes). They're intermittent though, and sometimes I'll be free of them for a few days or even a week at a time before they come back. I've gotten multiple different error codes and followed the advice for them I found online, but it hasn't resulted in a fix.

These error codes include:

• IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL  
• KMODE\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED  
• SYSTEM\_SERVICE\_EXCEPTION  
• PAGE\_FAULT\_IN\_NONPAGED\_AREA  
• SYSTEM\_THREAD\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED  
• KERNEL\_MODE\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED  
• UNEXPECTED\_KERNEL\_MODE\_TRAP

I used BlueScreenView to check the dump files and in all cases, ntoskrnl.exe crashed which presumably caused the BSoD. All of the information I found online said this was likely caused by some other problem, and the information for these codes suggested that I should check my RAM and my drivers, which I did, but it didn't help. These are all the measures I've attempted so far:

• Ran a full Windows Memory Diagnostic over the course of about 39 hours, this found no issues.  
• Used DriverFix to check for faulty or out-of-date drivers, I found several out-of-date drivers but none of them fixed my issues.  
• Ran sfc /scannow to check for faulty Windows files, found no problems in need of repair.  
• Ran chkdsk on both of my hard drives to check for issues, Windows repaired my C: drive which took several hours but did not fix my problem.  
• Ran in Safe Mode, didn't have any crashes but the problem sometimes does not appear for days at a time so this was inconclusive.  
• Checked for registry issues, malware, and other issues using Restoro, MalwareBytes, and Avast which did not solve any issues.  
• Checked for temperature or power issues with PC components, no issues found.  
• Stress tested my CPU and GPU to check for hardware failure, both handled the tests fine.  
• Updated my BIOS, didn't fix anything.  
• Re-installed Windows using a Media Creation Tool, seemed to be fixed for several days until it crashed earlier today.

The most recent attempt was re-installing Windows, which seemed to fix it as I hadn't had any problems since the re-install on January 7th. That changed today however, when my computer crashed immediately after I re-downloaded VoiceMod (I've been slowly reinstalling programs over the past several days to check and see if one causes an issue). I uninstalled VoiceMod immediately and checked for registry issues and such to make sure everything was deleted, but that didn't help. I ran a System Restore to yesterday from before I even downloaded it, but that didn't help either.

On a whim right before I posted this I decided to try chkdsk and sfc /scannow again and this time it reported faulty Windows files but it couldn't repair them. I have a copy of the log file here: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/blm0cadgz454hlk/CBS.log/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/blm0cadgz454hlk/CBS.log/file)

The issue happens more frequently when I'm playing games or watching something like Twitch or Youtube, but it doesn't happen exclusively when doing that. I've had it crash when doing nothing but working in MS Word or while talking in a Discord call. Some of these fixes seemed to fix it for a time but it's possible whatever causes this crash just didn't happen in that time frame. I have no idea if it's related, but I've also noticed my internet browser crashing or having pages crash pretty frequently, regardless of whether I was using Opera GX (my main browser), Microsoft Edge, or Google Chrome.

In case it helps, here are my computer components:

• AMD Ryzen 7 2700x  
• MSI RTX 2080TI Gaming X Trio  
• MSI B450 Gaming PRO Carbon  
• Corsair Vengeance RBG DDR4 3600 mHz (Clocked at 3200 mHz due to motherboard limitations)

Any help that can be provided is greatly appreciated, no generic advice I've found online has helped me at all and I'm hoping all this might provide someone with the information required to help fix my problem. I'm willing to try basically anything at this point, including buying new computer parts if that ends up being necessary. I just want to have a working computer."

Used a cheap keyboard we had and it worked for a bit, but then keys went out on it too. Works fine on my computer still.

Tried all the USB ports, both front and direct motherboard connections. Doesn't work still.

All drivers and software is up to date and seemingly seems to be fine.

Power supply seems to be stable. No issues with her mouse, cpu, or anything else. Runs games fine. It's a 550W Gold power supply and she's not running anything beefy.

Restarted her computer and drained the power supply, still messes up.

So my storage was full and I had no idea why. I looked into it and can't seem to find a solution, I have tried some of the other obvious stuff like disk cleanup but nothing seemed to work.

I made a post on a different subreddit and someone gave me a solution which I have been using since, and after I deleted the post. The person recommended Wiztree, which helps me find and delete whatever is taking up the space, which was the temp files. However, I have to do this every few days as my these files keep coming back, and after clearing up some other space on my drive it keeps growing. I have linked a screenshot which I took 20 mins ago where the temp files had grown to 40 gb. I am okay with deleting it every few days but was wondering if anyone knows what's up.

IRQL\_NOT\_GREATER\_OR\_EQUAL 

A KERNEL ONE

And,

SYSTEM\_SERVICE\_EXCEPTION 

My driver's are all updated. I checked earlier today. I also restarted after. I've had to do a system restore multiple times and then re-download and install basic apps/programs like anti-virus, vpn, browser, etc.

It's really annoying, especially because it's been happening like 5-7 times a day. I took this pc to a repair shop and picked it up 7 days ago (Thursday), downloaded the basic apps/programs and then it happened. I also have a controller because it's a gaming desktop, which might be an issue, not sure."
techsupport,Desperate: I did literally everything to my PC. It still won’t POST.,"I am so fucking sick of this piece of shit.

The problem started last year when my Ryzen 3800X with Asus Aorus X570 Elite wouldn’t POST. Apparently using only two of my four 32GB G.Skill Ripjaws V did the trick. Any of the two, mind you, in different channels.

I stuck to the old saying, “Don’t fix what’s not broken.” I stuck with 64 GB of RAM for about nine months until all of a sudden my PC wouldn’t boot. Now apparently putting any one of the four sticks into B1 slot did the trick. I had no idea why, but I decided to stick with just 32 GB as any other combination wouldn’t even let the PC boot.

Fast forward, I switched literally EVERYTHING in this fucking PC. Using an MSI Torpedo with Ryzen 5950X with a better PSU but a shitty GPU (1050 Ti). I switched RAMS to Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro.

Now it wouldn’t even boot with any RAM, regardless of the position.

What the fuck do I do? I am so frustrated and angry."

techsupport,Disk Usage at 100% due to Malware,"Greetings!

My friend's laptop has been acting so slow due to a 100% reading on their Disk Usage for about two years now. The event that we suspect triggered this mishap is when an acquaintance of theirs tried to install an Ableton Live torrent on their computer. After the installation, my friend claimed the computer ran painfully slow. We're very sure this is due to malware.

We've been trying to solve this issue for the past couple of years (they can't afford a new machine). We've tried restoring the system to zero, running multiple antivirus programs... But we just can't figure it out. The one thing we notice is that ""System"" is the one application taking up most of the usage.

But yea, I've never had any problems with it.  But I just noticed, whenever I go to this particular site statmuse.com after a little bit, vertical lines will start to show up on my monitor, and throughout the whole monitor not just chrome.  Like if I make the window smaller, it will show on everything.  

After I leave this site it will eventually go away.  But today, I left my computer for a little while and was on this site, and the image of the site was completely burned into my monitor, like even when I turned my computer off and the monitor was in power save mode the image of the site was still there. 

I left it unplugged for a little bit and now its back to normal.  I just don't understand why it only happens on this particular site lol. 

I can just avoid the site and use a similar one, but I'd like to know why it's happening.  Any ideas?"
techsupport,HELP! Razer Kitty Kraken headset makes my games/PC audio freeze up!,"I've had my razer headset for only 4-5 months, and for the past month or so it has been doing this annoying thing where when I'm in chat apps (Discord, Steam VC) while I'm playing games my game freezes, and my computers audio freezes. It usually turns back on by itself but it happens way to consistently and has only progressively gotten worse.

I've tried a lot of things already - getting rid of synapse, uninstalling other audio drivers, fiddling with pc settings, game settings, discord settings, etc. Have tried plugging it in into different USB ports. It works fine on my MAC laptop, but it only happens on my PC so I thought it was my computer but other headsets are fine. I tried the Corsair Virtuoso wireless on my PC with no issues whatsoever.

Tonight while I was watching YouTube the computer made a singular pop sound (sounded exactly like a balloon popping) and everything shut off and went black immediately. I checked for smells and smoke but smelled and saw nothing, not knowing what to do I unplugged the psu from the wall outlet and checked trusty google.

I plugged the PSU back in and tried to power on the pc but zero power, MOBO debug LEDs show nothing. I checked the MOBO capacitors and they looked fine, shined a light through the PSU and didn't spit anything but it's difficult to see without opening up (which I'm holding off from doing). I made sure the wall outlet was working, it is. 

Is it the PSU that's the likely culprit? It's throwing me off that I didn't smell anything after it happened."

[https://youtu.be/ZY4uKxMTARI](https://youtu.be/ZY4uKxMTARI)

**Issues:**

* Mouse is extremely laggy any time I go near my taskbar or the bottom of a window. In the video I linked you can see I try and resize Opera GX and it's very laggy and hard for me to drag the window,  I attempt to make small circles near my taskbar and I can't do them because it continues to lag and I have no idea why.
* All games I play (Valorant, League of Legends, Minecraft, Indie Steam games/RPGs) all have lag spikes that last 1-3 seconds. The games themselves are very smooth and I get high FPS but I still end up with lag spikes in all these games, my mouse lagging carries over to games as well and whenever I play Valorant and go to shoot it just freezes and then I'm dead, or when I look around it switches to 1FPS for a few seconds and I can barely move.
* Games are launching slow, I have a laptop that I played games on before my desktop arrived and Val loaded in probably 5 seconds while my brand new pc takes about 10-15. Any time I queue into a game I'm the last one that loads into the lobby however I was the first person to on my laptop (which has worse specs than my new desktop) which is just frustrating me more.

**Already Tried:**

* Setting both my mouse and keyboard to 500hz because apparently Windows 11 has bugs with peripherals being 1000hz.
* Turning off FreeSync &amp; Gsync which was said could be an issue with mouse lag however it didn't go away.
* Windows &amp; Nvidia Updates, whole system is up to date as of this moment.

I'm not sure what's going on and if it's a monitor or system issue but it's really annoying me and I'd like any help I can get. This is my first ever desktop and I already wanna go back to my laptop (i7 8th gen, GTX 1650 Max-Q) in any other way this desktop is amazing and runs fast besides games taking forever to load (not just Val, Steam games as well)"

techsupport,Hard drive sound: normal or abnormal?,"Audio: https://files.voussoir.net/_/20220110harddrivesound/

CrystalDiskInfo reports nothing alarming, and the drive has been fully functional.

You don't need to tell me to make backups, I've already got that covered. I am just wondering if anyone has heard it before.

techsupport,Issue with Bluetooth headphones and my PC,"Hello!

I recently bought some Bluetooth headphones (Skullcandy Hesh ANC) and tried to pair them to my personal PC (Windows 10, I'm not PC part savvy so I have no idea what parts I have sorry!). Instantly, there was an issue. The audio comes through choppy. I tried pairing the headphones with another device (My phone) and they work perfectly fine. 

The solutions I have tried included checking to make sure my drivers are updated, unpairing and repairing them many times, troubleshooting on the PC, checking compatibility (they are), charging the headphones to 100% (someone suggested it may help), and moving to various spots around the tower of the PC to see if I could get a clear connection. The last solution only somewhat worked because I found that if I pull the PC to a certain inconvenient spot I can use the headphones, but if I move the slightest bit, they become choppy again until I return to the spot. 

I am so confused and unsure where to go from here. It's not as if I was trying to use them through a wall or across the room. The tower of the PC is literally at the bottom of my desk. Am I missing something? Do I need to buy a signal booster of some sort? Any help is much appreciated!"

techsupport,Can someone give me some advice before my ordered items ship?,"It's kind of a long story, but I need to replace my motherboard, so I decided I may as well finally break beyond the annoying 2933Mhz memory cap ive always had with this old board and mem modules, so I also picked up some new RAM, clocked at 3600Mhz.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem actually stems from the fact that I have a... very annoying CPU. Particularly, a 10th Gen Comet Lake CPU, with no onboard graphics, the i7-10700F. As you guys know, prices are kinda all over the place... and as far as motherboards go, unless I wanted to pay over 200$ on the board alone, then I'd have to settle for the one that I did; which is the:

***Asus Prime B560M-A*** for $109.00 ... considering current prices, that's pretty good. Being brand new and everything. But then I realized that while this board does indeed take 10th gen cpus (being both 10th and 11th gen having the LGA 1200 socket) it apparently will not allow me to use the first M.2 slot, which to my understanding is the Gen4 PCIe slot for drives.

So, here's my question(s): Firstly, assuming I just got this board, would there be a problem with just putting my NVMe drive into the second slot, and all would be fine? ***My NVMe drive I currently have is the MSI M370 1TB Spatium*** drive, which I believe is what's known as.... PCIe Gen3x4? Meaning I can't take advantage of it anyway, correct? .... I THINK that I'm in the clear, but I kind of have a lingering feeling... you know how it is. The motherboard that I currently have is... strange. It's actually only BARELY listed on Asus website for petes sake. It doesnt even have a picture of it on there! It's known as ***Asus Gaming TUF B460M-PLUS AC*** .... that's right. There's an ***AC*** at the end. No, it's not the regular ***Plus*** and it's also not the ***(Wifi)*** board... it's an entirely different one. It's listing on the asus website, which can be found far easier when you click the actual GOOGLE result to the asus website, is right [here](https://www.asus.com/us/supportonly/TUF%20GAMING%20B460M-PLUS%20AC/HelpDesk_Download/). (You'll notice that you ALSO cannot find that motherboard on [pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com) either... it's so weird)

Anyway, here's a link to my entire build. I really appreciate ANYONE who has some insight. And please feel free to recommend a different board entirely, as far as the one in the beginning of the post, which I'm currently getting because I need a motherboard replacement for a different problem. Again, the board is an ***Asus Prime B560M-A.***

My computer would randomly go unresponsive and turn black (however the computer stayed on), the only thing that would bring it back would be to restart or reboot my computer.

I ran SFC, CHKDSK, etc; but nothing ever came up. I checked my event viewer for the critical crashes, and it showed a (event id 41, (70368744177664),(2)) which to my knowledge is a reaction to a problem and not the cause of a problem.

techsupport,"PC fully freezes randomly during gaming, and programs hang up occasionally.","I have had this issue for a long time now, and nothing I do seems to fix it. The issue being that my pc will completely freeze up for around 30 seconds at random intervals. It does not seem to happen much at all during use outside of games aside from individual programs hitching. Interestingly enough I can make the freezing happen less often if I turn the games graphics settings down, despite being able to run at high framerates (60-144) regardless of settings. This isn't specific to any game, either. 

Today I upgraded my CPU in the hopes a new one might solve the problem, but it did not. I have suspected the ram might be the cause for a while, but I have run memtest overnight multiple times with no errors, and also tried running on a single stick in both configurations to no avail.

I play a lot of multiplayer games, and freezing right before, or in the middle of a pvp fight is driving me nuts, and ruining my enjoyment of a lot of games. I am sure it must be a hardware issue as I have also done a fresh windows installation, to which the problem persists. 

Benchmarks usually are able to run all the way through with no issues, but I am willing to run any tests or etcetera that might help one of you figure this out. I would very much appreciate any help to resolve this. My PC specs can be found here: [https://pcpartpicker.com/user/camhawk10/saved/3QXpgs](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/camhawk10/saved/3QXpgs)

techsupport,"Laptop screen went dim, new replacement is also dim.","Hello all, recently my ASUS A15 gaming laptop screen had a black bar that was creeping up from the bottom, and it was driving me crazy so I decided to replace the screen entirely.

my laptop: [https://www.asus.com/us/Laptops/For-Gaming/TUF-Gaming/ASUS-TUF-Gaming-A15/](https://www.asus.com/us/Laptops/For-Gaming/TUF-Gaming/ASUS-TUF-Gaming-A15/)

 I followed along the with the videos to try replacing the screen:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urR8scfpTLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urR8scfpTLM)

but then I found that the screen I ordered wasn't the correct type (wrong # of pins) and had to order another one. When I put my original screen back, it was extremely dim (can barely tell if there's even anything on there). I read that would probably the inverter at fault, so I figured that I had probably broken the inverter on that screen when trying to uninstall it, and a new screen would come with a new inverter.

For reference, I'm currently typing this from the computer, by using an external screen that works fine, so it shouldn't be a graphics driver issue

When I got a new screen ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XYZPGY6/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o01\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XYZPGY6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)) and plugged it in, the new screen is ALSO extremely dim. There's a bar running below the actual glass part of the screen, so I'm pretty sure that's the inverter, and that should’ve been new with this new screen, right? Could I be getting a dim screen from a now-bad ribbon cable, and should I try replacing that?"

I recently bought four [G.Skill Ripjaws V Series](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/D6RFf7/gskill-memory-f43200c16d8gvkb). When using all four at once the bios doesn't boot.

techsupport,Have an issue with my Wyze cameras maintaining connection to my network,"I have two Wyze cameras. I am only able to connect one at a time to my network and that one looses connection and the only way to add it is to go into the Wyze app, delete the camera, then go through the process of adding a new device. Sometimes the first time doesn't work and I have to go through it again. Note these cameras are the only devices that have an issue in my network. Nothing else disconnects and has to be re-added like the Wyze cameras have to be. Plus I can only add one at a time. 

I have the Xfinity Blast plan at 300 mbps. I have quite a few smart lights connected to my network along with my phone, a Ring video doorbell, an Onkyo receiver, a Fire TV cube, an Alexa hub, 2 Echo Dots, and an Echo Show (yes I am addicted to the smart home stuff.  I occasionally have my laptop and my Kindle connected. None of those devices have any issues on my network. I even run a sync for many files between my laptop and my desktop that takes about 20 minutes each time with no issues. My desktop is connected through ethernet cable.

I contacted Wyze support and after going through much trouble shooting they sent me a new camera, which is why I now have two. Of those two I can only get one to connect at a time (doesn't matter which one) and then it looses connection within a week and have to follow the procedures outlined in the first paragraph. Note that Wyze support had me test my network connectivity and ranges with a special app and there were no issues found. 

I also contacted Xfinity support and they (not located in the US) immediately started trying to get me to go into a higher unlimited tier for my internet. He said that would solve my connectivity issues. If that was the case then I would have issues with other devices.

I have been on the Wyze forums and there are a few people who mention they have more than one camera (one has way more than 10) and they have no issues even with all their other wifi connected devices. Some say it is an issue with my network, but if it was would I not also have issues with my other wifi connected devices?

I personally think it is either an issue with the Wyze app itself or the way the Wyze devices communicate with my network. But I have no idea. 

I am a computer geek and have built many a PCs and repaired many laptops (that even the supposed techs at the places who sell laptops could not fix). But networking is not a strong point of mine. 

Any help or ideas are greatly appreciated. 

I would also take suggestions for universal camera apps that I might be able to connect my Wyze cameras to in hopes that I could get it to work."
techsupport,Wifi Issues,"I live on a boat in a marina that offers Wifi services on all the docks. I am purchasing a multi device plan that offers high speed wifi up to 4 devices. At first the wifi was great, I was able to game and work  with no issue. Sometimes when the marina is really busy I noticed a decline in the internet but at night it was always super fast. About 3 months ago the internet started having issues, almost as if it randomly drops off every 3-4 minutes. I noticed it because I do a lot of zoom calls for work and I would  be dropped from the call and have to rejoin. The issue is now permanent. Even when refreshing a page sometimes it seems as though my wifi is not connected to wifi but after a few seconds reconnects and loads the page. My computer never actually disconnects from wifi.

&amp;#x200B;

I downloaded ""inssider"" after many attempts to try and explain to the wifi company what was wrong with the wifi but unfortunately they have been no help. I am not very tech savy so I cant really explain my case very well but I am hoping someone here can help me understand what is going on. The signal strength is not really an issue it is pretty steady at -59dBm. The issues that Inssider presents to me is this:

1. 2.4 GHz Coverage.
   1. There are a lot of access point in range. This can cause clients to stick and also clutters the RF space.
2. Non-standard 2.4 GHz Channel.
   1. An access point in your network is using channel 5, which is not a standard channel and overlaps with the standard channels of 1, 6, and 11. Using non-standard channels decreases the throughput for everyone and can increase the retry rate. 
3. Too wide 2.4 GHz channel
   1. We recommend against using 40 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz band. The entire 2.4 GHz band is less than 100 MHz wide, and even the standard 20 MHz wide channels create enough overlap to be detrimental. Using a channel wider than 20 MHz wont usually improve your throughput, and can increase the retry rate for all networks in the 2.4 GHz band, which is bad for everyone. 
4. 2.4 GHz Configuration Mismatch
   1. Your access points in the 2.4 GHz Band are not all configured with the same HT Capabilities. We recommend configuring all access points in each band stream.

Thank you for any help anyone can offer so I can easily explain what is going on to this wifi company so they can fix what needs to be fixed so my work and personal life can be better."

techsupport,AMD 5900X better performance with only 1 CCD,"Hello.

I upgraded from 5600X to a 5900X, but in game (apex), it feels somehow worse.

The CPU runs average on 4500Mhz and 90C , 25% usage.

It just doesn't feel as smooth as with 5600x, it ""feels"" kind of sluggish to play.

----

However, in Ryzen Master i set Active CCD Mode to ""1"" instead of ""2"" (so now less cores are running i guess) and for some reason, the performance improved. It feels smoother.

The CPU runs average 4500-4600Mhz at 83C, 30% usage.

---

I don't know much about computers, but common sense tells me its one of the following:

1) The problem is overheating cpu, which cause the game to feel sluggish. --&gt; Solution: better cooler

2) The problem is that because CPU is now more powerful (5900x &gt; 5600x), the GPU gets pushed more so the GPU usage is too high (90%,60C). --&gt; Solution: limit fps

3) Because 5900x has 2CCD, its causing some sort of input lag. --&gt; Solution: buy 5800x

Can someone please tell me which of these scenarios is more likely, or if none of them are and its something completely different?

Thank you."

As you can see, there's a clear issue with my GPU as Nvidia doesn't offer drivers for my GPU on 8.1. Recently upgraded to it not realizing this issue, but it runs fine on my monitor (3440x1080) but doesn't run games. I tried installing Windows 10 -&gt; install failed and no info on the issue. Went through microsoft help and forums to troubleshoot. Did disk repair in command prompt, uninstalled unnecessary files and applications, disabled windows firewall, uninstalled malwarebytes, unplugged external devices during install, etc. Still receiving the error message about 70% through the install stage. I tried to install the Nvidia drivers I would need if I \*was\* in windows 10 to see if that was the issue. I know that all drivers should be updated for the install.

I still have my old GPU (Radeon r9 270) that can run on this PC but doesn't allow me to reach this resolution. Would switching it back in and trying the 10 install possibly work? I'm out of ideas and about to do a full backup and wipe or send it in.

Thanks!"

techsupport,"Four particular programs not executing, getting Windows Application Error 0xc0000005","Hi r/TechSupport,

I hope this is an interesting one for you folks:

I have 4 programs that will not run (and never have on this system). Launching the application (as regular or admin) seems to do nothing, no loading screen, error pop-up, nothing.
In Windows Event Viewer, I can see that Windows tried to launch it, but there is an Application Error.

The non-executing applications:
* *RStudio* : Latest, and required for school
* *Scrivener* and *Godot IDE* : Non-critical but exact same problem
* *SketchUp* : No Windows event, but has its own bug report pop up

What I've tried so far:
* Uninstalling (completely) and reinstalling
* Fresh installs after checking for any temp files or registry keys
* Installing with Firewall (Windows) Off
* Installing with Anti-Virus (Windows Security) Off
* Updating Windows
* Updating drivers

Searched anything searchable from the Windows Error Reporting (the only tangible things I could search):
* Exception code: 0x c0000005
* Fault Bucket type 5

Not much out there, but some posters suggested possibly a hardware fault? So:
* Ran sfc : No problems found
* Ran chkdsk : No problems found

My system:
ASUS ZenBook UX434FL running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit

I'm at a loss as to what I should even search for next. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

techsupport,PC crashing for seemingly no reason. (I have been trying to fix for probably a year now),"So over the past year or so, my pc has been randomly freezing/crashing.

[(Link to PC Info)](https://storage-asset.msi.com/specSheet/us/desktop/Aegis%20RS-002US.pdf)  
This issue happened on the original hardware, but I have since switched ram and it still happens. It usually happens during or after running a fairly intense game (Tetris Effect on max settings, Apex Legends on max settings, the benchmark for Forza Horizon 5, Fortnite at max settings {or close} maybe more but that's all I remember atm.) I have tried resetting graphics card drivers, reinstalling them, removing programs that could potentially cause problems, same with drivers, ran a memory test before I got my new memory, dual booted on windows 11 and it still happened there (fortnite and apex), installed CrystalDiskInfo and my ssd is fine, I have an external hard drive plugged in all the time so I unplugged it for a while and it still happened, the only thing I can think of that I haven't tried (besides replacing most of the hardware) is completely factory resetting my pc, but since I have tried using a clean install of windows 11 and got the same result, I doubt that's the issue. Windows updates have also recently stopped installing properly, but I don't know if that's the issue, and I'm reluctant to reset my pc.

I know that I should have better ventilation than I do, but I can't really fix that atm.

TLDR: I have tried everything I can find and think of, and nothing works. My pc keeps crashing randomly and I can't do anything about it. Any help, or ideas for things I could try would be greatly appreciated."

I bought it from a colleague of mine and he said it had, but from the start I couldn't get it to work. I know it was dumb not testing before buying, but I really needed it at the time. It worked with an ethernet cable, so I was ok with it. I thought ""ok, I'll figure out the wi-fi later"" but never got it to work. The manufacter's website says that by pressing ""Fn + F3"" it turns on and off, but I tried it and it doesn't seem to work (In fact, it shows an option of extra monitor/duplicating screen instead of wi-fi options). The drawing on the F4 shows a, what I assume, wireless symbol, so I tried pressing it too and there was no difference. 

I've tried:
1. Uninstalling and installing drivers.
2. Checking for updates
3. Installing different drivers
4. Fn + F3
5. F4

I'm not sure what else to do, since I've tried everything that comes to mind.
Also, I think the ethernet connection stopped working, so the laptop is just pretty just sitting there waiting to be fixed.

I have been away for December so I haven't started my PC for about a month until yesterday. I started it and tried to play the new GTA 5 update but my PC kept restarting as soon as I get in game. 

On reliability checker it said that desktop window manager stopped working a bunch of times. I tried to do all the solutions that I found online such as: running the scannow command on CMD which came back with nothing. Disabling automatic restart which didn't help. And a bunch of other solutions.

After a while I tried a clean windows 11 install (I had windows 11 before). This had the same issues. So my guess is that it is hardware related. 

Thoughout this time I could switch on and unlock the PC just fine. If I did nothing then the PC would never turn off. I also noticed that settings would crash when changing the display options. 

After a while I got fed up and decided to try switch to windows 10. After using another PC to make a media creation tool, I plugged it in and tried to install windows 10. 

I got to the point just after you finish installing windows just before you sign in to your account and select what features you want when my PC shut off and I cannot get the screen to turn on. 

When I try to turn it on the fan lights turn on as well as the keyboard lights but the mouse lights don't work and the screen doesn't work. I also can't turn the PC off with the power button after I try to turn it on. 

I need a solution to get my PC on and stop or resetting. Or I need to know what part I need to replace.

So my wife has been using my gaming laptop (HP Omen) to run her business. She is a wedding photographer and uses a lot of Lightroom and photoshop. The computer has been unbearably slow especially when making changes within Lightroom and exporting. I want to build her a new PC but everything is extremely expensive and I'd rather wait until HOPEFULLY the prices come down to a more reasonable cost. 

So im thinking of upgrading the laptop instead to save some money and make her happy. 

Here are the specs of the HP Omen:

Intel i7 7700 @2.8 GHZ (FCBGA1440 socket)
40gb RAM 
128gb internal SSD 
12TB hard drive plus two external SSD's for photo storage (we will figure out a better, long term solution in the future)
Nvidia 1050 GPU

The CPU typically runs at 30-40% when doing normal tasks (email, Facebook, etc) but when she is in Lightroom or photoshop the CPU runs at 100% and is boosted to around 3.2GHZ. Everything else within task manager is super low except for RAM which runs at around 50% on average. 

So should I build a new PC or upgrade our current laptop? If we upgrade, do you think upgrading to an i9 would be the best move?

&amp;#x200B;

I first thought the usb port was broken, but i tried pluggin the llcd USB and i could boot it as normal. I believe the HDD is broken. Something i forgot to say before is that I used gparted when i had the llcd, in order to wipe the drive. Should i just get another new drive?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, i will put the specs of the laptop:  
\- CPU: intel celeron N2820 2,13 GHz

\- RAM: 4096 MB

\- BIOS version: 1.60

\- HDD/SSD (im not sure if it his and HDD or SSD, but i think it's HDD): TOSHIBA MQ01ABF050

\- The battery and charger work well, no issues

\- Laptop model: TOSHIBA SATELLITE C50-B-16T

techsupport,Data lost or recoverable?,"HP Omen 15, think I got it in 2017 so it’s a kinda old. Here’s my story:

Laptop tried updating one day and I shut it down without knowing it was updating (hate this auto update feature even when I turn it off it still does it). Anyways it worked fine after but would keep trying to update every so often and run into an error cause the update was corrupted now or something. Fast forward to last week I turn my laptop on and it’s a black screen when I get to the login screen. I restart and it tries to diagnose, gives me an error and brings me to advanced options. I go to troubleshoot then advanced options and try uninstalling updates, error, try command prompt and checkdisk, doesn’t work, startup repair doesn’t work either. I go back to “reset this PC” and I choose keep files and it gets to 2% then gives error. Now I’m trying the hp recovery manager but when I try to add a file to back up it stalls for a minute then exits to the previous screen. Are my files just dead and I have to do a factory restore and delete everything? Will it even work or am I missing something? The kicker is I literally ordered an external SSD to back up my files last week and the day after my computer does this.. it hasn’t come yet so I’ve been testing backing up smaller files to a USB (maybe this is why recovery manager keeps backing out?)."

I'm trying to install Windows 10 onto an older laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad T500.) I am doing an in-place upgrade from 7. 

It has 6GB of RAM, an SSD, and a Core 2 Duo.

During the process, Windows 10 will BSOD and then tell me that the install failed due to Error Code 0xC1900101 - 0x20017. It also says ""The installation failed in the SAFE\_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation."" It then reverts back to the old OS, which is exactly what I'm trying to get away from.

I have had another ThinkPad T500 in the past and it was able to run Windows 10. So unless this laptop has a defect, I don't think it is a matter of its age being a factor. How can I rectify this?"

I received a display drawing tablet (Huion Kansas 13 Pro) as a gift for Christmas recently - I had been using a Wacom Intuos for over 5 years at this point but the Kamvas is significantly different due to it being a display tablet. I tried using it and the display just did not work, I tried everything it said on the official Huion site but it continued to show “no signal” and went to low power mode. The tablet worked without the display, I could use the pen on both my PC monitors but the display on the tablet itself would not work.
The official site and Amazon support pretty much told me I needed a replacement - lo and behold the replacement tablet ends up doing the exact same thing. I try everything I tried with the first tablet, again doesn’t work, so I end up getting frustrated and get a refund on the replacement and return it.
I decided to go with a Wacom One this time, since I’m more familiar with Wacom and their hardware seems to generally be more reliable that Huion or XP Pen from what I’ve gathered. Now I’m in the same situation AGAIN. The tablet mostly works, but the display won’t work and always says “no signal” and goes to low power mode when I try to turn it on. I feel like I’ve tried basically everything but there has to be something I’m missing in regards to my PC itself, again any help is appreciated as I am getting exhausted trying to figure out what the issue is lol"

Pretty much every time I play games, the game runs great but crashes to desktop once or twice every 2-4 hours. It's really annoying as I generally play Fall Guys with a team of friends and then I leave them hanging. It's not just one game though. Other games have the exact same symptoms.

Our office is located on the very top floor and due to the number of devices we have up there we use a switch to split the one ethernet port up there into 4.

I have emailed them numerous times (the email listed on the device lock screen) and they won't reply anything other than ""we do not process the unlocking, contact Samsung"", Samsung say they cant do anything about this either. 

Looking at reviews, this company is a straight up scam: https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/mtr.co.uk

Question is, is there anyway to bypass this lock? I don't care what it takes, this company is scum. As far as I can tell, this lock is done through Samsung Knox Guard as when I email I get my message I sent through the phone with the automated ""A user has sent you a message through a device that is enrolled by your company in Samsung Knox Guard.""

techsupport,5600x Periodic Overheating," 

So I have a 5600X on an ASUS F Gaming B550 Mobo. I use a corsair H115i watercooler (with 2 fans attached to the radiator) and have 3 additional chasis fans.

My idle temperature is typically 40 degrees and in-game, rises to maybe 75 degrees. However every 2-3 days, it starts going to 60 degrees idle and 95 degrees in game. The corsair temperature monitor for the cooler seem to suggest that it is functioning and the coolant is reaching 55-60 degrees when the CPU hits 95 degrees.

After hitting high 60s in idle, I then unplug everything, open up the case, lay it flat, ensure all connections are plugged in properly and fans are not the problem, close the case back up and restart the computer. For some reason, the temperature drops back to the idle 40 degree amount. I am not too sure what the problem is. I thought it was the cooler but it seems to be functioning and I did reseat it once.

techsupport,I got a new SSD and CrystalDiskInfo says that the total NAND writes are 423219928 GB (403.614 PB). Is this just a mistake or is my new SSD faulty?,"The title says all. Here's a screenshot: [https://i.imgur.com/5S4sPvk.png](https://i.imgur.com/5S4sPvk.png)

I am pretty worried as I just had an older SSD start to fail on me, probably due to overuse. And so I got a [Seagate IronWolf NAS SSD that can withstand heavy amounts of use](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-Internal-Solid-State/dp/B08FNX4KY4). But I bought a new one, not a used one, so the fact that it has not only some NAND writes on it, but PETABYTES of NAND writes on it, seems concerning to me.

However recently my games haven’t been working as usual, and i mean like my fps is super low and the game becomes unplayable (valorant is at 15 fps when usually it’s a 60-140, and minecraft can barely run 5 fps) 

I checked my cpu and it’s at 90 degrees celsius (which is about 194 fahrenheit) when it’s idle, no games running. 
Ive factory reset my pc already and checked the task manager, there’s no apps taking up the usage (i only have valorant installed atm)

I’m not sure how to fix the temperature from being so high, especially since my gpu is sitting at 23 degrees celsius only (73 fahrenheit)

Also i’m not sure if the cpu is the reason why none of my games are playable (i can open them but sometimes they crash due to the low fps)"

I travel relatively frequently for work and one of the best ways for me to stay out of trouble is to bring my PS5 with me. Generally, I am able to get around most hotel TV barriers, but I have met my match.

I unplugged the Ethernet cords and all of the other cables that were connected. I tried the main two answers I could find on the internet which was hold the menu/settings button for 7 or 20 seconds, etc. I could very well have messed up, so if that is 100% the answer then feel free to correct me.

techsupport,My phone &amp; Chromebook think I'm Indian/Arabic,"I wouldn't normally worry about something like this, but I need advice because it's starting to bother me. 

Something within the workings of my phone and Chromebook seems convinced that I'm Indian. I'm an English guy in the UK. My location, everywhere it can be set, is set to United Kingdom. Yet for a month or so that I can remember now, I've been seeing recommended searches in YouTube for things like *'param sundari'* or *'surah rahman'* to name two I literally just saw. It occasionally happens in Chrome too, but rarely compared to YouTube.   
I was prepared to chalk this up to the UK's high Indian population and whatnot. Sure, I guess their influence would affect what YouTube would recommend to a Brit. But now I've just been on Twitter mobile. I typed a hashtag '#' and was immediately shown a list of six trending tweets. Three of them were in Arabic script and one was Hindi, I think.  

I don't think it has anything to do with our WiFi, as the BT hub was recently restarted and the oddities persist when I switch to 4G. I have never once looked at, clicked on or expressed any interest whatsoever in Indian or Arabic culture and no one else has access to my phone, Chromebook, or any account of mine.  

Am I being paranoid or is there genuinely something to be concerned about here? If so, what can I do about it? If not, why is it happening?"

I've searched on the internet and done many thinga to try and fix it:
 - I updated most drivers
 - Reinstalled GPU drivers
 - Ran countless scans on the Windows Powershell
 - Did some checks on dxdiag
 - Tried setting my computer to only use one of the GPUs (both Intel UHD and the Nvidia one)
 - And last of all I tried formatting my laptop with a USB stick.

The issue isn't too frequent, sometimes I can go an entire day without it happening, sometimes it happens twice a day, sometimes even prevents me from using the PC for more than 2 hours.

This rarelly happens but it can lead into another BSoD code (DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE) which hasn't appeared in a while...

I'm afraid that if this keeps going that the BSoD will start appearing more and more often and make my machine unusable.

My last option is admit it's a hardware issua and send it back for repairs but I'm a University student and I can't exactly stay without a computer for long.

All was well, the day I got it I left it on when I went out for like 10 minutes, I came back and saw that I was in BIOS

&amp;#x200B;

I thought nothing of it and was like ""huh, that's weird"". 

That evening I was chilling with the laptop when it crashed.

""Wow, weird"" I thought and used it again. The error code was Uncorrectable WHEA error. 

Now let me teror that each time it crashes it leads to a different stop code, one thing they have in common is that it may be cause by bad drivers.

I continued using it and it CRASHED AND CRASHED. I was annoyed and called it a day, closed the laptop and went to sleep thinking why was it happening.

The next 2 days I think it only crashed once or twice, however they all had one thing in common. 

**THE DISK USAGE ALWAYS QUICKLY RISES UP TO 100%, EVERYTHING FREEZES AND THEN PROCEEDS TO BLUE SCREEN.**

Over the week it crashed many times, I noticed it never crashed when gaming, but more when I used it to watch youtube, browse the internet, leave it doing nothing etc.

I was finally done with it crashing and tried reinstalling the drivers.

That did nothing.

Reset fully system? Nothing

It started breaking, files wouldn't open, search bar didn't work, It was unusable.

I told the person who ordered the laptop and set it up for me (I payed for it) what was going on and they were like ""Aight, bring it to me and I'll take care of it"". After waiting a week they decided to take a look at the laptop and instantly conducted that it was a driver issue as I've figured already. 

They gave me a call and said that it was caused by me installing bad drivers and causing everything to fall to shit. When I explained to them the whole story they didn't belive me and said that BIOS dosen't boot up after a crash and a reset (IT STILL DOES, I DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING IN THERE TO BE CLEAR).

They were quite irritated and I then started doubting if I had actually installed any fresh drivers and said that maybe I don't remember.

They sighed, booted up BIOS and said that they were going to fix it using BIOS.

They sent me back the laptop and I was happy and thankful that it was alright.

SKIP A WEEK

I didn't touch any settings, touch drivers, anything, I was making sure I didn't touch ANYTHING, because I was so scared of causing it again.

Well one night I came into my room to see BIOS on. I thought that I'm going to get a heart attack.

It crashed 5 times that night.

I knew I couldn't reach out to that person, because they wouldn't belive me, wouldn't help me and they would yell at me. I can't return it, or anything, because that person has the papers. 

I can't do anything.

I've tried googling, but only found one person on reddit with the same issue that posted about it. When I asked them if they found a way to fixed it they said that they are still struggling with it.

Well, here we are, a few months later and here's how I learned to deal with it and things I noticed:

1. **DISK USAGE ALWAYS HITS 100% BEFORE CRASH, EVERYTHING ELSE IS ALRIGHT**
2. **IT NEVER HAPPENS WHEN PLAYING VIDEO GAMES, I STARTED THINKING THE LAPTOP FEELS THE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING BEING DONE WITH IT, BECAUSE IF LEFT IDLE, IT WOULD JUST CRASH.**
3. **IT DOSEN'T FEEL LIKE LETTING ME BROWSE THE INTERNET, USE DIFFERENT SOFTWARE**
4. **REINSTALLING DRIVERS DOSEN'T WORK**
5. **IT'S BEING MOODY AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S A BABY THAT CONSTANTLY NEEDS ATTENTION. MAYBE I NEED A PRIEST AND NOT IT SUPPORT FOR IT.**
6. **SOMETIMES WHEN BOOTING UP THE DISK CHECKS ITSELF BUT FINDS NOTHING, DISK CHECK FINDS NOTHING, CCLEANER DOSEN'T FIX ANYTHING, TRIED FIXING THE REGISTRY.**
7. **THE CRASHES MAY BE CAUSED BY THE DISK NOT BEING ABLE TO HANDLE 100% USAGE, THE CRASHES NEVER HAPPEN WHEN DOWNLOADING (RARELY, BUT CERTAINLY NOT CAUSED BY THEM)** 
8. **IT HAS NO SPECIFIC TRIGGER**

I probably forgot something so I'm going to keep editing it and adding stuff to it to make sure that I've said everything, I sometimes feel like it's alive and being mean to me, crashing at the worst of times like when I'm filling up a document.

I've been obsessed with having task manager on, scared to look at the desktop for longer than 5 seconds. 

It's quickest crash was before I even managed to type in the password (It's 4 letters).

It crashed WHILE installing windows.

I have no idea what to do, I've tried asking for help on forums and it lead me to nowhere, 0 replies, or 1 suggesting something like ""Have you tried updating the drivers?"" ""CONGRATS SHERLOCK, I LITTERALLY TALKED ABOUT HOW I DID AND THROUGH DIFFERENT SOFTWARE""

techsupport,"WIFI router issue - internet connection is lost every ~8 hours, Devices still connected to router, but no internet","Hi,

I hope you'd be able to give some assistance with this. As I am starting to loose hope and irritated by reading all the guides stating to - reboot it, maybe there's some blockage to the signal etc etc. and my knowledge on the subject is not that big so I am getting lost.

&amp;#x200B;

We have Archer C5 router (not provided by ISP), we use it solely for WIFI. It is connected directly to the cable from ISP (no Modem in between).

The issue is that every 8 hours the Internet is lost. We are able to see the WIFI router with devices, but if we try to access internet we get error: 'WAN connection error! Unable to connect to the internet etc'.   
IF I do the re-set to factory settings and set up the router again it works like a charm without any issues, but then after a while the issue starts again and persists until I'd re-set the router again.

We've tried to contacting the ISP, but after noting that it is our device they were reluctant to assist, but notified to look more in to DHCP, but it is too tricky for me.

The issue should not be related to number of devices, placement or other casual things, because after the re-set the router can work with no issues for a month or few, before the issue starts again.

Has anyone experienced this? The connection is lost like a clock after 8 hours all the time, I hope this would be a good hint.

///

Seperate question, the ISP provides Dynamic ID, would I even be able to set up router with Static IP address? And would it help in any way?"

* The other IcyBox for photography in Raid1 mirrored on another NAS drive (same disk size)
* The two remaining NAS drives mounted in Raid1 for other family members stuff

Could it be a good solution to create a Raid5 volume on the NAS and simply mirror everything onto it within different folders (one folder for each IcyBox and another for family stuff)?

techsupport,Losing drive mappings after logging out of VPN,"I work a company that outsources IT to an MSP. Ive experienced many networking issues while WFH, and they always bat me around the tiers, Jerry rig a fix, then close the ticket, only to have an issue resurface a short while later, when I have to start the process over again. 

The latest issue is that am connecting to my work network through a windows 10 laptop and VPN client  (ssl, built into windows 10). Whenever I log off and back on, I lose drive mappings, and I have to use the net use command to unmap and remap them. 

I have no issues with mapping drives to one of the servers, but the other throws an error that says, ""multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using more than one user name, are not allowed. Disconnect all previous connections to the server or shared resource and try again.""

Also, whenever I log into the VPN, I get an error that says, ""the identity of the VPN server could not be verified due to the following certificate issues: server certificate is untrusted, invalid server certificate name."" Their solution (which has been tried before and failed) is to replace my laptop. I doubt this will resolve these issues, since it seems to be something on the server side or maybe however they set up my group policy. I'm not an it/networking guy, so no clue. Looking for help, been dealing with this for almost 2 years, and no tech so far can get it fixed. Only time it worked properly was when I used SonicWall netextender to VPN in on an old windows 8 laptop. According to one tech, that program is no longer supported, so using it is no longer an option. 

Relatedly, I use the VPN to remote into my work computer, which is a pc in my office that is on the same network as the servers. I never encounter mapping errors when accessing the network drives through the remote desktop client.

Thanks in advance."

Hey Folks,

Got a weird issue here and I am running out of ideas. I setup a Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5 14ALC05 for a new hire and it kept crashing on her (every 15 minutes or so). It was originally equipped with Windows 11 but we wiped it and installed windows 10.  First BSOD said DP WATCHDOG VIOLATION and DRIVER IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL as stop codes. Now it's saying what failed is the rtwlane6.sys driver which is the wifi driver as the main culprit

I deleted the driver from device manager and rebooted to reinstall it but issue persists. Installed the one on lenovo's website but issue persists. I updated BIOS and chipset straight from lenovo's website but issue persists. Laptop is full updated in terms of windows updates. Here's the kicker, I gave her a different laptop(same model) but same issue occurs. In device manager, it's using the Realtek RTL8852AE Wifi 6 802.11ax PCIe Adapter. I ended up giving her a USB wifi receiver which uses different drivers and disabled the original realtek drivers. It hasn't crashed since. Any other ideas on what I can do? I am surprised no one else has complained yet cause I've been issuing these out for a while. Then again, most people are connected via ethernet using a docking station. This particular user needed to use wifi because her desk setup wasn't ready yet thus bringing light to this issue."

and AC adapter with a C6 socket going to the laptop power jack.

and into a UK wall socket, everything works OK.

However, if I use a cable with a UK plug going to a C5, it doesn't charge. (That cable is fine charging another device, and another cable of the same type also doesn't work.)

As far as I know and can read the specs, it should all work, UK and EU current should be close enough for the AC adapter to handle both, and if anything I would expect the cable that fits the wall socket + AC adapter to work better than plug adapter + cable with the wrong plug for the wall + AC adapter.

I could buy a UK replacement 2 part charger, but I don't understand how that would be different from using the original AC adapter-to-laptop part, and a random (working) UK plug-to-C5 part that I'm trying now, so a bit wary about spending money on that.

It's not a big deal just using the setup that works, but since I don't understand why the other one doesn't work, I'm a bit concerned that I'm doing something wrong and that long term use is stressing the AC adapter or the battery or something.

But the XBOX doesn't let me move games to an USB drive that doesn't have at least 128GB capacity, which would make sense if I were to play new gen games directly from that drive, but unnecessarily restricts me from doing what I want to do. **I do NOT intend to scam people.**"

I performed a Q-Flash from the BIOS and the update was successful. As soon as I boot the OS up, I can see the lock screen but my screen freezes after a few seconds and I can also hear the fan noise getting louder.

Solutions tried:

1. Re-flashing the BIOS: Tried the same procedure again, just to make sure that the BIOS was properly flashed. But still the problem persists.

2. Boot into Safe Mode: OS boots with no issues into Safe mode. But again when restarting normally, screen freezes like before. :(

Any other solutions would be appreciated."

techsupport,Help! My Galaxy Book Pro thinks it is an 2015 Lenovo laptop.,"Hello!

Long story short, I'm not really tech savy or experienced in handling malware on my Galaxy Book Pro. I ended up deleting temp, local and roaming. I paniced when I realized that I couldn't access my drives, settings and stuff and everything also went pitch black all of a sudden. I had considered whiping the drive since nothing else had succeded before but after that I coulnd't even use the system to make a recovery key. So before the virus could leak the content of my nasty beastiality cookies, i quickly used my old ass Lenovo laptop to act as source for the key.

Now my Galaxybook has an identity crisis and thinks it is an old Lenovo. Microsoft noticed that license was registered to another device and restricts Windows.  

To get the Windows product key for my Galaxy Book I need to get my laptop to realise it's a Samsung. But I can't get it to do so without having access to programs which I need an unrestriced Windows for. So I'm in a moment 22 right now. Microsoft costumer support refers me to Samsung which in turn refers me back. Somehow the device has disappeard from my Samsung Accounts so I can't get it from there either.

I tried to make a new reinstallation, hoping that the new recovery key's identity would be based on BIOS, which it wasn't 

  
Is there a way to solve this? It seems unlikley that I would be the first person to do this ."

techsupport,What did my ISP do to remove my CGNAT restrictions?,"Previously, I was behind a carrier-grade NAT and I couldn't forward ports. This double NAT situation was annoying and I proceeded to complain to my ISP that I  didn't want to have to call them every time I want to forward/open/close a port and also most of the time they didn't actually open any ports on their end.

A day later I noticed my WAN IP was the same as my public IP. I'm probably still in the same network but I don't understand what they did to solve the problem. I don't think they just gave me my own IP. Is there a process where it seems like I have my own IP but really they just forward all ports to my router without affecting other customers?

I need to know the specifics because I might move soon and if I encounter this problem again I want to be able to tell customer service exactly what I want. Calling them doesn't really help since the only people that understand what happened are only reachable via a support ticket."

techsupport,BSOD Kernel Power 41 - service center didn't help,"Hi everyone, as the title indicates, I'm experiencing regular BSODs and in event viewer the **critical event is Kernel Power 41**. (I'm not very tech informed so I'm just describing what I'm seeing, sorry in advance)

I have actually just received my laptop back from the Asus service center and they told me they replaced the motherboard :) so I have no idea what they think they fixed if the problem is still ongoing.

The laptop is an **Asus Zenbook UX534FTC** (1TB SSD, 16GB RAM, i7 core, NVIDIA GTX 1650) and I've had it since October 2020. I use it for work (Photoshop/Illustrator) and gaming (FF14 mostly). It BSOD'ed once or twice right after I got it but not for a long while after that so I let my guard down. Then I sent it to the service center for overheating, they told me they replaced a ""thermal module"", and the BSODs became more frequent. I would notice that when I put the laptop to sleep overnight, I would wake up to it having force-restarted and closed all my open files/tabs/programs etc. It also began to happen when the laptop was idle. I would be able to run games on it fine but once I left it to sit for a while it would BSOD, then restart in a split second so I could barely catch the error code.

I left it at the service center for a week since I had paid for extended warranty (which I kind of regret now). They returned it to me yesterday *set back to factory settings* saying they had replaced the motherboard and it was fine now. But today again it's BSOD'ed several times with the error code **CRITICAL\_PROCESS\_DIED**. I looked in event viewer and it has happened many times over the past few days (while it was being worked on at the service center) and right up to an hour or two before they gave it back to me lol so idk.

I have tried to uninstall the Mcafee that comes preloaded but it did not help. I've just set it to create a complete memory dump the next time it crashes so I will pastebin that somewhere in an edit when it happens. Have messaged the Asus customer service about this but they're not the engineer team so I'm not sure if it will get through to anyone.

Thanks anyone and everyone for any input. I've been really frustrated with this laptop the past few months and if it hadn't cost me a decent chunk of cash I'd already have sprung for a different one, lol."

techsupport,Can powerline adapters cause harm to my PC?,"So long story short, we got two new PCs and in terms of networking options, ethernet isn't an option, nor' is MoCA. So we have a choice of powerline and wifi basically. Our Wifi is okay, but powerline gives higher speeds and a more consistent connection, so that's what we would ideally like to use.   


My concern is because our PCs are connected to a surge protector, they're fine. The powerline adapter has to be plugged into the mains, and connected to the PC via ethernet. Is there any danger that it can cause to the PC? I'm not an electrician and don't pretend to know anything about this, I'm just concerned that it can surge and damage something.   


I had an event yesterday where on both PCs, at the same time, the ethernet ports on the motherboard got error code 10. After about 2 hours of figuring out what caused it, I found a power cycle fixed it, but at the time they were connected via powerline. Is there anything I need to worry about or should using these be fine?"
techsupport,Realtek Audio drivers not installing?,"Recently, I upgraded the GPU and motherboard on my PC to find that no audio was able to be output. Once I reconnect the PC to the internet it automatically installed the required NVIDIA drivers, and using the NVIDIA HD Audio driver it can now output sound via the HDMI, to preface NVIDIA HD and my microphone were the only sound drivers listed in that category. After looking into it myself this is apparently a common issue, and I reinstalled the Realtek drivers manually. However after reinstalling the issue persisted, only Nvidia HD and my mic listed. Worried I had accidentally installed something malicious by mistake I decide to use a restore point, and, to my surprise the PC recognized that I had installed the Realtek driver, and had listed before the installation as the newest restore point. This is the part where it becomes most confusing. Apparently windows recognized a Realtek driver was installed, but the driver was not listed in the device manager or anywhere else on the PC. I still cannot get audio out of any port besides the GPU’s HDMI. Any explanation or advice would be appreciated, thank you."

\-alternatively - A way, in windows 10 pro, to schedule a task on workstation unlock (Also possibly wake if unlock doesn't cover this) that does not require the above policy to be edited that can be enabled from the command line (Not logon, That only works when the user logs off properly not when they close the screen or simply lock their workstation)

2 - disable the ""start the task only if the computer is on AC power"" checkbox in the task scheduler for existing scheduled tasks. (I have created a batch file to enable the schedules but that option does not seem available with the schtasks command.)

techsupport,Updating Intel Rapid Storage Technology," My company uses Windows Defender for vulnerability scanning and it's recommending that we update Intel RST on around 100 of our PCs, including my laptop.

The version numbers of the affected machines vary (e.g. 15.7.5.1025, 16.7.9.1027, 17.0.2.1076) with my laptop having 16.8.3.1004.

However, even though Windows Defender says that these machines need a newer version of Intel RST, using my laptop as a guinea pig I was unable to find a newer version - even using the Intel Driver &amp; Support Assistant (and Dell Update utility).

So this leaves me with some questions.....

1. Is it possible that for these PCs there isn't a newer version of Intel RST available?
2. If a CVE says there is a bug in the older versions and there is no newer version available for any specific machine, I presume that machine is still vulnerable to the issue mentioned in the CVE, even though technically it is as up-to-date as it can be?
3. How would I automate the checking/downloading/installation of any available updates using InTune if the updates are machine-specific?

Hoping you helpful people can help to shed some light on this for me, so TIA."

techsupport,Transfer a Windows 10 Pro Upgrade license to another computer?,"I've spent a couple hours searching for relevant info on this, and what I found either didn't match my situation or was outdated, so forgive me if it's a repeat question.

We had an OEM Dell Windows 10 Home laptop that we bought last year. We upgraded it to Windows 10 Pro using the Microsoft Store. That computer then quickly died. We bought a new OEM Dell Windows 11 Home laptop.

The question is this: can we transfer that Windows 10 Pro ""upgrade license"" to the new laptop?

I've seen conflicting information — some people say the upgrade license still counts as OEM since it was upgrading an OEM license and is thus nontransferable; others say that it counts as a separate Retail license.

To further confuse things, when I log into our Microsoft account and click on the product (""Windows 10/11 Pro""), I get [this page.](https://imgur.com/a/OUAbkAd)

I'm pretty sure that, since it was bought in the Microsoft Store, the license doesn't have a product key.

techsupport,Windows 10 display driver freeze since LG OLEDC1 FW 03.21.05 (dwm.exe appcrash KERNELBASE.dll)," 

Hi,

since  my 1 month old C1 did the fw update to 03.21.05 i have massive problems  with my multi monitor setup. i have 3 displays on my rtx 3090 (latest  driver 497.29 installed) connected.

main desktop 32""display --&gt; displayport

c1 --&gt; hdmi

another 24"" monitor --&gt; displayport

For  desktop work only the 32"" is on, the c1 and the 24"" are on my sim rig.  the c1 is always in standby mode the other display and the whole sim rig  only get power when in use, controlled by a powerstrip.

So  when i want to switch to the sim rig config i just turn the tv and the  power strip on. windows then change the main display to the c1 and the  24"" as extended display. this is still working but as soon as i turn off  the c1 windows freezes now the the display turns black for a minute or  longer, sometimes the picture comes back, but screen configuration isn't  anymore available (dwm.exe appcrash KERNELBASE.dll).

what i've tried

* different display driver versions
* disabled windows fast startup
* turn on/off g-sync
* turn on/off hdr
* tried different refresh rates 60/120hz
* unistalll/reinstall with ddu in safe mode
* windows repair installation
* different hdmi cables
* tv factory reset

i  can 100% reproduce the error everytime. if the tv is not connected  switching/turning the other two sceens is no problem. also i can play  games for hours without any crashes, it just happens when turning off  the c1. the last thing i can think of, is a firmware downgrade, but not  sure how to do.

anyone can help? thanks"

techsupport,Can constantly going into Sleep Mode and waking it up fry your HDMI port?,"So my computer kept waking up the second it went into sleep mode. This is the first time it's done this, so I wasn't sure what was the issue. I tried changing some settings so my mouse, keyboard, headset, etc. wouldn't wake it up but it kept doing it. After around the 6th or 7th time putting my PC to sleep, one of my monitors just stopped working. I plugged the other monitor into the HDMI port with the monitor that's not working and it also didn't work. However the other HDMI port works fine, even though both ports are part of the same HDMI hardware (Sorry, I don't know much about hardware terms lol) I went to device manager to see if my HDMI just stopped completely and I really can't tell. It shows my graphics card and ""Intel(R) UHD Graphics 630"", which I'm assuming neither has anything to do with HDMI.

At this point I'm just really frustrated and confused. Why does my PC keep waking up from sleep even though my wake timers are disabled? Why does only one of my HDMI output not work but the other one works fine??"
techsupport,Monitors crash when gaming/pc has to reboot,"Hi there,

I've spent weeks now looking into lots of posts online and on here about this issue and everyone seems to have their own different fixes that haven't worked for me, so I'm hoping I can find some help.

As the title says, lately whenever I've been gaming both of my monitors turn off as if they lose power and just say there's no signal. Sometimes this is an hour into gaming, 30 mins, or 2 mins. Sometimes I can go a week without it happening but the last 2 days it's every time i boot up a game (games like FFXIV/Genshin Impact/Dead by Daylight for instance).

I'm 100% not tech literate but here's some info, if you need more let me know (and apologies if you need to spell things out for me like a simpleton).

Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 2700 Eight-Core Processor 3.20 GHz

Graphics Card: Radeon RX 570 Series

I'm using two of the following monitors: Samsung C27F390 27-Inch Curved LED Monitor - HDMI, VGA, Black Gloss. Both are plugged into the GPU - one via HDMI and one not (i forgot the term - scart?). I unfortunately don't have 2 HDMI ports on my GPU.

I've tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling my graphics card drivers. I've even tried rolling back to a previous update. I've tried uninstalling recent Windows 10 updates just in case it was that. I've got all games set to the minimum graphics settings. I've tried reinstalling the games. Nothing seems to fix it and it's getting worse. I think I may need to upgrade my GPU as I bought this 2 years ago when I built the PC myself. But as GPUs are ridiculously expensive right now I'm reluctant to do that if it's not going to be the fix.

It also does the same thing when I run a stress test. I'm starting to get really stressed out about this now and I honestly have no idea what to do any more :("

Does this degrade the battery a lot? I usullay turn it off when it's not in use.

techsupport,Some apps don't connect unless i use a VPN,"Hi, about two weeks ago i started having some connection issues with 2 apps (Epic launcher and LOL, maybe there's another but i manly use this ones). To explain fast the problem: when i open Epic launcher it stays with a black window forever and when i checked the troubleshot logs it said that 4 back-end connection tests failed, and as for LOL, around every 1-2 matches i get disconnected randomly and i'm unable to reconnect even if i close and re-open the game. In both cases the internet worked fine as i had Firefox opened and did a speed test without any problem ([speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) and fast.com) .

The strange thing is that if i turn on a VPN connection (i use both Windscribe and hotspot shield) i no longer have this issues. In the Epic launcher case i only need to use a VPN when logging in and after that i can turn it off and browse store without any problem. And in the LOL one, the second time i had a disconnect i tried using a VPN and it re-connected without a problem but when i turned it off i got dc again.

Any help or tip would be appreciated. Thanks

\- 3080 ti

\- ryzen 9 5900x

\- 32gb of ram 3600mhz

\- 1tb ssd

\- 4tb hdd

So Basically I built my PC a month ago, with these specifications. Now here's the problem: When I first built my PC, I tested out my frames, temp and usage on different games as you do. My frames were very high, like 800 - 1200 (even tho im not using those lost frames, it's still nice to see that). My temps were at like 60 for both, and I can't really remember usage. Now after a month of playing on low settings for most games, and countless games downloaded onto my ssd my ""high end pc"" doesn't seem so high. Nowadays, I can barely run mid settings at 144fps. I realised my ssd had 40gb left on it, so I thought that could be the problem. So I freed up a lot of space, 500gb to be exact. I also updated the bios and still its running terribly. My ram is running at its correct speed and on xmp profile. Fortnite for example, is at mid settings and it can't even keep  stable 144fps. I played Minecraft optifine a month ago where I was getting 800fps, now it can't even do 90fps. I've had enough and I've decided to reset my pc... i think. I'm confused on what I should do and have no idea whats gone wrong. The temps for example are completely fine (55+ when idle, and 60-68 when playing). Should I reset my pc? And if I should, is there anyone willing to help me ""setup"" my pc for optimal gaming performance once it has reset. Discord: AJ.exe#6431"

So I restarted, thinking I'll run through all my driver's in device manager after, but Windows never came back.

I got stuck in a bootloop, so I went into the bios, checked my version, removed my XMP profile and tried again to no avail. 

This is where it started spiraling, I reseated all the components I could, RAM, GPU and NVMEs, still it wouldn't boot to windows. 

So I thought, fuck it, I'll reinstall, it was only a young machine and I didn't have much on there, but in trying that, I couldn't get the bootable USB to work, it would only show the windows logo and the loading icon then after about 10 minutes BSOD again.

And this is where I am at, I took my drives out, checked them in another machine, they worked okay. I sanitised my boot drive and tried again but I still can't get the install going.

Short story: WiFi stopped working on my pc and after calling the internet “provider” I followed the advice to upgrade to windows 11. Seemed easy enough. But it isn’t. 
First, I tried simply downloading it through windows update. Didn’t work, as the download never “installed”, all I could do is try to download it multiple times without reaching the installation phase. Very annoying. 
So I went on the web and searched for normal causes and fixes. 
1. I checked tpm.msc that it was ready.
2. Checked bios that safe boot was active
No problems there. So I had to try something else.
Found a guide suggesting 2 other methods. 
1. Use the iso file
2. Installation assistant 

1.1 I download the media creation tool w11
1.2 I use the tool to create an iso 
1.3 I mount it and run the setup 
1.4 installation is complete 
1.5 “windows 11 installation has failed” 
Tried 3 times. 

2.1 I am using the installation assistant as of right now. 30min into installation and I am 1% in. 
I think you can imagine the struggle.

Say that method 2 also doesn’t work. What do I do?       By now I have used almost all my internet data for this month sharing WiFi to my pc, and I am seriously considering selling my vivobook to buy a Mac instead.

So, using command prompt, I pinged both 8.8.8.8 and my router to look for any issues.

I then chose to plug the PC directly into the modem (it was plugged into the router before, I'm using ethernet). Ran the pings tests to 8.8.8.8 and to the modem itself.

**Currently**:

* *MSI X470 Gaming Plus (up-to-date BIOS)*

* *16GB(2x8) DDR4 Corsair Vengeance LPX 3000MHz 15-17-17-35* *(in the recommended slots)*


So I have tried numerous things to adjust RAM speed through the BIOS to what it should be -- 3000Mhz -- and despite the steps I've taken, the speed remains at 2133Mhz as seen through Windows and CPU-Z. Really, the only thing I have yet to do is test a single stick on its own, but that doesn't necessarily solve my problem, just verifies an issue with the hardware.

* I have disabled and enabled XMP profiles. When enabling profile 2 (2933Mhz), the computer goes into a reboot loop.

* I have enabled XMP profile 1 without any effect.

* I have manually adjusted the RAM speed to 3000MHz. I have turned off memory fast boot.

In trying to research the issue I have come across a few other cases where users are having similar issues with Ryzen and Corsair Vengeance memory, especially with these timings, which is why I think I'm going to buy new kit.

I started up the program (PokerStars) and was playing a bit but I kept being disconnected and that’s obviously horrible when money’s literally on the line. 

My question is this: would an Ethernet cable directly from my modem/router (sorry idk anything about technology) give me a stronger connection than using wifi? It says I have roughly 30% connection when using the site and every other player has 100. 

I have Xfinity 400 mbps internet and it says it’s running at 118% of my plan’s speed.

GT 710 GK208 rev B1

BIOS 80.28.A6.00.01

2GB

Not overclocked

Driver 472.12

Monitor 1 is HDMI, monitor 2 is DVI

Symptoms:

When launching Disney+ in the browser, as soon as the video starts to play monitor 1 (the HDMI one) goes black. When the Disney+ tab is closed the monitor turns back on. This is replicable 100% without fail.

Unplugging the HDMI cable from the back of the HDMI monitor and plugging it back in will restore the image on the monitor and it will stay on until the next time Disney+ is closed and launched again.

This happens only with Disney+ and not netflix, amazon prime, google play or youtube, which are the only video streams I use.

techsupport,1050ti with no power supply,"so I am pretty clueless when it comes to hardware and also a broke student so when I need to buy PCs, I go for prebuilt options.

Last time I did this i got a pretty good PC with an okay GPU but then wanted to be able to play VR smoothly and so I upgraded to a 1050ti. The problem here is that most 1050ti GPUs dont have/need 6 pin power supply but mine is gigabyte and does.

this has been fine with this PC as it had a six pin power supply cable but this PC is unfortunately dying of old age. 

when looking at new ones, ones that come with as good or better GPUs are out of my price range and so I plan on getting one with a crappy GPU and just switching it out for my 1050ti. the problem is that when I look up the GPUs they do come with, none of them need power supply and so wont come with the cable (i ordered one with the hopes that it did anyway and had to return it as it didnt.)

from what i have read, when you dont connect the power supply on the 1050ti (of the ones that have the port), it leads to pretty severe performance issues.

should i risk using it without a power supply?
if not, how easy is it to wire up a 6 pin power supply myself?
the PC i am looking at comes with a GT1030, should i just make do with that?

i am honestly clueless in this area so any advice is appreciated but please be nice lol"
techsupport,i9 12900k CPU running hot,"Recently I just built a new pc with a i9 12900k CPU. The CPU cooler is a AIO unit, Aorus Waterforce X360, mounted to the top as an exhaust. I've got 3 fans on the front of my case for intake aswell. When I first built it, I ran Prime 95 to stress test and within seconds the cpu spiked up to 100°C on a handful of cores. It kept jumping pretty rapidly up and down. I freaked out and stopped the torture tests, and turned off my pc in fear of frying something.

The next day I rethermal pasted my cpu, just in case this was causing the increase in temperatures. Running prime 95 again, I get the same things. Temperatures spike to 100°C in some cores. I know that prime 95 isn't typical of general use of the cpu so I wasn't too concerned with that. But recently as I've been playing games I've seen temperatures spike up to 92°C. Generally it only happens for a brief moment and then drops back down to average around the 60-70°C mark. My idle temps seems good aswell, averaging high 20's - low 30's °C.

Secondly, the issue...

I work in a school with two external phonelines and multiple internal extensions (systems are not VoIP). We have one user who shows as constantly engaged. Below are the things I have tried so far:

* Switching the phone out for a known working good
* Turning the main switchboard off (twice - once, for seconds as it was during the day, second for over 30 seconds on Friday afternoon to give it time to completely power down and reset)
* Opening the switch to remove and reconnect the connected wires (blue, orange, green etc.) 
* Removed the phone from the extension socket and left the line for 20 minutes. 

The only thing I can now think of possibly doing is removing the phone AND powering down the main switch, but I'm unsure what that would do and due to all the programmed options (Press 1 to report absences etc.) I'm fairly reluctant to reset the whole thing for one blinking internal line!

So, I panicked and promptly system restored to right before I installed Throttlestop.

Now, Genshin and other games run fine but now have stutters where the fps drops from 60 to around 53, over and over again. It's driving me crazy.

I've tried returning the BIOS to default settings, restoring GPU to default settings, restoring power plans to default, system restoring to an even earlier time, switching hardware accelerated GPU scheduling both on and off and reinstalling the latest Nvidia drivers.

3 or 4 days ago i pressed the sleep button on the windows power logo and i accidentally removed the power cable from my pc, my pc still turned on like the fans were working. my monitor just did not turn on.

the next day, after trying  removing the power cable then i removed the cmos battery and ram it finally came back to life. my mom was using my pc at the time and i asked her how she turned off the pc, she said she turned off the pc by pressing shut down on the desktop.


another day later it happened again, the monitor was completely working, but it was stuck on the motherboard logo, i youtube searched on how to solve this but i tried everything, like removing cmos battery, ram, enabling fast boot, reseting my bios settings to default and im still stuck at the motherboard logo. i haven't tried removing my cmos, ram, ssd all the same. but im scared of trying because what if my pc will no longer work after this...

i have projects to pass to my teachers and i cant really do it since my files is in the ""broken"" computer...

12600k

I've plugged in the 24 pin power and the 8 pin cpu power.  I notice there's another 4 pin next to the 8 pin but I don't have a power supply connector for this.  Not sure if it's needed.

Using a corsair rm650 power supply.

When trying to get the system to post, upon turning on the power supply the mobo led's will flash once, but nothing will happen when I press the rst switch.  Power supply fan doesn't move, cpu fan doesn't move.  Can't see any other lights on the board.

I've connected to a monitor via display port.

I've tried using a single stick of ram in each channel.  Tried with just the 24pin to see if there was a change.

Any help appreciated."

techsupport,"Getting a ping spike from my router every 15 minutes or so, wondering if I'm interpreting my results correctly.","Hi there,

Noticed that, out of no where (this wasn't happening a few days ago) I was getting the occasional ping spike in my games. So, using command prompt, I pinged both 8.8.8.8 and my router to look for any issues. I found that every 10-15 minutes, my router will take ~300ms on a ping instead of the typical ~1ms, and as a result, the 8.8.8.8 ping will also be in the hundreds.

I then chose to plug the PC directly into the modem (it was plugged into the router before, I'm using ethernet). Ran the pings tests to 8.8.8.8 and to the modem itself. There doesn't seem to be an issue with this. Every ping to the modem is under 1ms, and my ping to 8.8.8.8 is where I expect it to be.

So, if I'm interpreting my results correctly, this is an issue with my router, correct? We've had it for over 4 years, which I've read can be toward the end of a router's optimized life cycle. This only started happening within the last few days, but I guess it has to start somewhere. Any input?"

PC shut off without warning while gaming (Back 4 Blood). Nothing else running besides Discord. I'm talking full black screen, not even a bsod. Running Windows 11. Wouldn't turn back on. PSU (Cooler Master MWE Gold 550W) makes a ""tick"" sound when I try. The PSU fan does seem to spin for a second.

Fully rebuilt the whole system using a brand new motherboard (B450 Tomahawk Max -&gt; brand new B550A-Pro), and outside of the case which is an NZXT H510 Elite.

Only attached the CPU (3700x), AIO (Kraken X63), RAM (2x8GB XPG Spectrix 3200 cl16), and SSD (Crucial P1). Jumped it with a screwdriver to the power switch header on my motherboard. Same issue.

Added GPU (ASUS Dual OC RTX 3070) and same issue. The GPU light flashes momentarily.

Also tried switching the RAM sticks, only 2 RAM stick, unplugging and replugging all the PSU connectors, disconnecting all USB devices. Seems like something is shorting it but I don't know if my PSU is just straight up dead after a year.

This issue has happened before of not being able to boot. I rebuilt it outside of the case and was able to jump the power switch to boot it reliably. I then rebuilt it in the case with front panel/hd audio/front panel usb connector disconnected (because I thought the case was causing the short). I have since left the PC on for a couple weeks in fear that it wouldn't boot again if I shut down. That was until this happened again and I can no longer seem to boot it up.

There was also quite rapid flashing of white on top of my phone's screen and very like filtered color changes for a short bit after starting it up again but that has ceased occurring completely now in my small amount of use since and likely will not happen again. That may have been the adaptive brightness being effected by whatever has happened to my phone as I did turn that off and it has stopped since. It is worth mentioning it was quite wet and raining today so perhaps that has caused this issue.

Outlet 2 - Office area: 220/240V max, 3.5A total amperage without laptop

Test 1:
- HDMI plugged in, charger unplugged, TV area
- plugging in charger trips breaker
- breaker does not want to switch on unless laptop unplugged.

Test 2:
- HDMI plugged in, charger unplugged, office area
- Plugging in charger trips breaker
- breaker does not want to switch on unless laptop unplugged

Test 3:

So I check if the Licensing Service is actually running, and it never is.. I try to make it start but I get this [**Error 1053**](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Error-1053-Unable-to-start-Autodesk-Desktop-Licensing-service.html?us_oa=akn-us&amp;us_si=ea3880e7-c21a-44f8-8597-59911d865a14&amp;us_st=error%201053)

although with Option 4 for Error 1053, I cannot get past Step 12 because it would simply not let me start the service.

This is just a guess, but maybe it is my Local Computer/Service that is the problem? I find that it always loops back to the Licensing Service issue because I just cannot get it to start.. How might I fix this?

techsupport,Vertical Lines on Monitor when connected to docking station,"Hello techsupporters, 

I recently bought a ASUS VG27AQ1A monitor as a late christmas present to my self to use for gaming at higher refresh rates, and I am having some strange issue that I can't find an answer to and I can't seem to solve.

The monitor works fine with my desktop PC, no issues at all.

But when I connect it to the docking station for my laptop (I work from home) I sometimes get these big vertical lines all over the screen; [Pic](https://imgur.com/CzYTKDg). I have not been able to reproduce the problem 100%, but it seems to occur after the laptop has been in sleep mode for some time, like when I get back from lunch or when I start my work day. After about an hour of restarting/recabling/changing settings it usually gets back to normal again, but I can't seem to find a consistant solution that solves it.

efore I bought this new screen I had some Dell 2560/1440 60Hz screen which worked without any issues and was also connected using displayport cable to the same docking station. The lines do not appear in BIOS/menus, and since it works on my desktop PC to me it seems that the monitor is not the problem.

Things I have tried;

\- Changing refresh rate on the screen, laptop screen runs natively at 120Hz, I have tried running the new screen on 120, 100, 60, 59 Hz, all with the same result.

\- Changing resolution (laptop runs 1080p natively while screen is at 1440p, tried running it at lower resolution but still had the lines)

\- Changing the displayport cable

\- Changing to the second displayport connection on my docking station (it has two, I use two extra monitors, both with displayport, the docking station also only has displayport, USB-B and ethernet connections).

\- Restarting everything (including the docking station of course)

\- Connecting the screen directly to the HDMI port on my laptop (then it works normally, but lines reappear when I reconnect it to the displayport on my docking station)

\- Connecting it back to my desktop PC (always works on my desktop PC (then it works normally, but lines reappear when I reconnect it to the displayport on my docking station)

Now I am at the point of not being sure what I should do, I can't really switch between two different screens for gaming/working, and gaming on my 60Hz screen is just horrible. My only thoughts of why this problem occurs is that there's some power issue in the docking station, or that the docking station and the monitor uses different displayport versions (could this cause this kind of issues?

techsupport,How do I get my computer to use my SSD and not my hard drives?,"**Full disclaimer: I know very little about computers, so I apologise if simple jargen goes over my head.**

&amp;#x200B;

I updated my 2011 PC to run on an SSD because it's faster than my internal hard drives. The process was an ordeal for me, but I managed to get it to work. However it will sometimes still use the old hard drive version of windows instead of my new SSD; it was like a game of chance when booting on my PC.

I have tried using disk cleaner to remove ""old.windows"" and manually deleting every associated file, only for it to still happen upon restart. Eventually, I discovered a workaround for it: unplugging the hard drives and plugging them back in AFTER the SSD operating system boots up. Formatting said old hard drives isn't really an option as there's over 1800GBs of stuff I want to keep and don't have the means of easily moving as my SSD only holds 930GB (less than that now).

Last week, I took it to a PC repair guy and also asked if he could also fix said issues with the operating system. I told him about how I would unplug the hard drives and he told me [I shouldn't because they're internal drives.](https://c.tenor.com/n4PoD8FUdrEAAAAC/homer-collar.gif) Lesson learned. He said that he never encountered my old operating system in the 3 days he spent testing it by letting it run Minecraft all day. He doesn't charge me anything and I take it home. I plug my computer back in and...It's still trying to use my old hard drive instead of my SSD. With my local PC guy unable to resolve it, I turn to Reddit tech support.

Please can someone help me with this! And can you please keep the explinations simple for a simpleton like me? If you need more information, I can (try to) provide it.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** My PC it intended to run on a SSD and uses the previous old (internal) hard drives for storage. But most of the time, my computer uses the old version of my operating system on my hard drive instead of my SSD. I've tried deleting the old version of windows on my hard drive but the problem still persists. I use to resolve this by unplugging said hard drives before the PC boots up, but apparently that's really bad for it."

techsupport,Help needed for computer advice!!,"for reference, I am 17, just got a job over the school holidays, and am saving up cash to buy a new computer. I am also, from new zealand, so recommendations please be available in my country!

The requirements I would like for the computer to reach are:

1. Compatable for schoolwork, google docs, google classroom, photo, video and podcast editing.
2. Good for the sims 4 ( I freakin love the game!)
3. Pretty sturdy as I am clumsy sometimes ( although I could just get a good computer case and keyboard cover-I get crumbs in them sometimes...)
4. Preferably no touchscreen as I feel it is unnecessary and my brother might swipe me out of important pages.
5. Available in New Zealand
6. I can take to different places. on the go.
7. Space for schoolwork, personal projects.

Thank you so much, advice is very much appreciated!!!"

techsupport,"Just bought a used R5 3600, good fps but game feels a bit choppy","Hey guys,

(Specs below)

This is my first time writing on Reddit. I've been a PC gamer for about 15 years and never really got into PC parts before recently. I bought a used computer 2 years ago and everything was fine. Few days ago, I bought an used Ryzen 5 3600 on FB marketplace to replace my R5 1600. I installed it with the help of my friend. Everything seemed ok. I launched Valorant, started playing, noticed that my FPS was where I wanted it to be, pretty much at 200 fps constantly but then I felt choppiness when I was peeking angles and just moving around. I felt sick in my stomach, this is mostly why I decided to write to you guys for advice.

I have downloaded the latest chipset drivers using [https://www.amd.com/en/support](https://www.amd.com/en/support)   
I have tried so many things to fix the issue but nothing seems to be working. I am at a lost right now.

My power plan is at High performance, my monitor is set to 165hz in windows and in Nvidia settings.

In my Registry Editor, there's 2 AMDRyzenMasterDriver, V13 and V19. Could that be the issue or this is one stupid question? Do I need to delete one of the 2? Also, is it recommended to go into my BIOS and Load Optimized Default settings? I ran Cinebench R23 without any programs running in the background (Beside CPUID HWMonitor) to keep an eye on the temperature. I got a score of 8.8k which is I think what is it supposed to be at. One last thing, my GPU drivers are up to date.

Let me know if you guys have any idea, it would make me feel a little bit better about my purchase !  


GPU: GTX 1070  
CPU: R5 3600  
PSU:  Evga 550w gold modular

techsupport,Intel wireless adapter stopped working with code 10 and I am completely stumped,"I have a Dell Inspiron 7586 2-in-1 laptop running on Windows 10 21H1 and a while back the wireless adapter (Intel-AC-9560) just totally stopped working. In the device manager the status says that it cannot be started, code 10. Things that I have tried so far include

* Doing a clean re-install of the driver
* Attempt to update the driver (I'll get to that)
* Resetting the BIOS options.
* Doing a fresh install of Windows 10

Updating the driver is a whole new issue. I have read that some users were able to resolve the issue by updating the driver to a later version, implying it is an issue with Windows 10, and that versions 22.70.x.x would resolve the issue. On Dell's website there is this driver, which according to them is supported by my model.  
 [Intel AX210/AX200/AX201/9260/9560/9462 Wi-Fi UWD Driver | Driver Details | Dell US](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=17rmr&amp;oscode=wt64a&amp;productcode=inspiron-15-7586-2-in-1-laptop) 

When attempting to install the driver however, it fails with the message ""This installation is forbidden by system policy, contact your system administrator"", even when being done from the local administrator user account. I went into local group policies and disabled the policy preventing users from installing vendor packages, but it changed nothing. Other drivers this doesn't happen with. For example, there was a graphics driver listed there that was said I should also install. It was also listed as compatible and sure enough that installation worked and updated the driver without any issues. Between attempting to update the drivers and other listed attempted fixes I am not sure what else to try really.

Here are the logs for the updater. I didn't pick out any useful information really, but I figured I may as well include it.

techsupport,Connecting a laptop to 2 monitors,"So I have a Windows laptop with 1 HDMI port and 1 Thunderbolt port. I usually connect it to one monitor via HDMI. I'd like to try connecting it to two monitors and extending the desktop across all 3 screens (laptop screen + 2 monitors).

I was just hoping people here might be able to advise on whether this is doable, and what's the best way to go about it?

Could I connect one monitor via HDMI, and then the other via Thunderbolt? Or could I get an adapter that would let me connect to both via Thunderbolt? I'm not sure if my monitors have Thunderbolt ports on them so I might need to get an adapter with 1xThunderbolt in and 2xHDMI out.

Also, can I connect a Thunderbolt cable to a DP port?"
techsupport,Computer restarts,"My computer randomly restarts on me when doing stuff and it could be at random times or pretty specific like during certain games and only those certain games. The whole thing just restarts, doesn't skip a beat as in the fans powering down or any lights inside going off and will boot back up instantly. No blue screen or scheduled restart. It's not over heating, the ram isn't corrupted, and the psu has been replaced and upgraded. It'll crash on minecraft and tabletop simulator but run games like Smite, Snow runners, and Valheim perfectly fine.

techsupport,"Trouble Installing windows 11 on New Computer, possible trouble with ssd","Sorry if this has been dealt with already. I tried searching this sub and couldn't find it.

I am building a new pc. The specs are as follows:

Motherboard: Asus prime b560-plus
Cpu: i5 11600k
Cooler: cooler Master hyper 212evo
Ssd: teamgroup ms30 SSD SATA III 6 gb/S (1 tb) 
Ram: g. Skill tridentZ rgb (16gb)
Psu: antec earthwatts gold pro 750 w
Gpu: Currently none installed, but I do have my old gpu: zotac gtx760 2 gb (not installed, seems to not work)
New gpu: (on the way) Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1650 4gb

I've got two potential issues:

Problem #1: my motherboard didn't detect the ssd when it was installed in m.2_1. I moved it to m.2_2 and the Bios now lists it. (problem 1b) It also doesn't really fit well: the install slot (where it actually connects) and a rubber spacer on the mobo are at one height, and the spacer nut where it screws in is a little shorter, so that if I tighten it all the way it's arched slightly. But like I said, the bios detects it so maybe that's not a problem.

Problem 2: I tried to install windows 11 from a disc (DVD?). It claims that my computer doesn't meet the windows system requirements (but doesn't specify which). As far as I can determine, even without a gpu installed, it does. I've found a few blogs and articles addressing this, but they are mostly geared towards users who have a working pc with windows 10 running. Are there any solutions to this problem on a new pc? Could the weirdness with my SSD be the problem?

Thanks for the help! I'm going to bed now so if there are any questions I'll answer them in the morning."
techsupport,Windows Audio Service consistently stops picking up my mic.,"As the title states, Windows Audio Service seems to consistently ignore my microphone. I can consistantly cause it to drop by muting the mic (Logitech G935 headset) with the button on the headset, and I frequently have to open the services manager to restart the Audio Service to fix the problem. I quite like being able to mute my mic at the touch of a button, and this really gets in the way of D&amp;D specifically, as I mute between swapping voices with Voicemod (I've tested and simply swapping voices without muting doesn't cause the service to stop).

I've tried updating drivers, using the system file checker to repair any damaged files, restarting the PC,  and nothing seems to help. Google also doesn't seem to pull any results that help either. Does anyone know what might cause this sort of issue? Again, it's only the mic that stops, and all sound output functions just fine as far as I can tell."

I've set a native  3840x2160 resolution wallpaper as my lock screen/login wallpaper, but now and then when I reboot my computer it shows up pixelated/blurry. If I reboot it's normal again.   

It's not really a big problem, but I'm wondering why it's happening?    

I may be naive, but I thought Windows 11 would further help increase native 4K support, but it still feels like there are occasional issues with dialogs that are blurry at times, and after a reboot, it's better. Does not feel really reliable."

techsupport,Laptop Stutters and I hear a loud BRRRR sound through my headphones randomly when gaming,"Hello,  
I recently bought an ASUS ROG Strix G17 Gaming Laptop and everything was running well, I would play Red Dead Redemption 2 on ultra at \~60-70 FPS. However recently, I've been getting random 1-2 second stutters where the game hiccups and I hear a loud BRRR sound through my headphones before the game goes back to normal. I run my laptop in Turbo mode, so perhaps if I run it in performance mode the problem might stop, but I don't want to sacrifice the FPS in game. I've looked at task manager after the stutters occur and I don't see any spikes in GPU or CPU, but do notice some change in the Disk graph. Could this be an SSD issue? Is there a way to fix it?

When gaming on 1080p monitor, it will run on short time then no signal. 

Specs:

Windows 10

All never overclocked

CPU i3-10100f (New)

GPU Gtx1650

PSU Corsair cv750 (New)

RAM Ballistic 3200mhz (New)

  
My isolation did first was to change the PSU then change both cpu and motherboard because I'm still using old 3rd gen intel. Next is I let my friend use my Monitor and GPU on his PC Intel 3rd gen and did an stress test and play some games yet we don't encounter any issue. 

  
After that isolation the GPU, Monitor, CPU and motherboard should be clear.

So it comes on my OS, I freshly install Windows 10 then boom, same issue. 

And of course I both update and use old version of nvidia driver. 

The only remaining thing that I can think of is the cables. But I really don't think that was the faulty one cause I also used it on my old 720p monitor.  


My pc is basically new after those isolations, and my gpu is only 7 months old. 

I fix this before by underclocking gpu on MSI Afterburner but this only works for 1 week.

If I miss something please do tell me. TIA"

techsupport,Ever since upgrading to 3060 ti from an RX5600 XT I'm getting massive FPS drops,"Hey all - Kind of at my wits end with this one. Here are the specs:

&amp;#x200B;

* Asus B550 m-a ac
* Ryzen 5 3600
* 32gb Corsair RGB Pro 3600 (2x16)
* EVGA 650w 80 PLus Bronze
* Asus Rog Strix 3060 ti OC LHR
* CoolerMaster ML360R 360 AIO
* Win 11 (was running win 10 pro, but changing to Win 11 seemed to help with Black Ops Cold war issues)
* Lian Li 011 Dynamic with 3 side/rear exhaust. 3 bottom intake, 3noctua's running intake on AIO
* Asus 1440p 165hz monitor
* CPU and RAM are OC currently. Issue happens without or without OC. GPU is stock atm.

Issue is that when playing only certain games the frames will drop to 15 or below - usually 1. This is the GPU dropping to 15% or lower usage. This happens on Guardians of the Galaxy no matter the settings every minute or so. This happens on Shadow of the tomb raider unless its on settings lower than my old 5600xt could handle. Other games as well. Warzone and Cold war run great.

Hitting Windows key or alt-tab brings frames back instantly and they return to crap as soon as the game is in the foreground and the main on-screen program. No rhyme or reason to when it returns to normal. It chooses when. Longest was about 2 minutes. Fastest was about 10 seconds.

I've done massive troubleshooting but I cant really find any issues. No bottlenecks... I was thinking its either the card or the mobo. Mobo is known to run very hot (not sure if issue), and card was bought brand new from NewEgg (shuffle winner). Temps never get above 65c for CPU. GPU never gets above 55C. I think it was even low in the stress tests.

Stress tests are very good.. cant figure it out. Any advice?"

Hyper 212 evo 
Corsair 110q


It worked fine for the first few months, up until Christmas Eve, where out of nowhere, the pc shut off with a bsod (Too fast to see the error so I don’t know what it was) and then refused to turn on completely. At first I thought it was the psu so I replaced it with a Corsair 750 watt 80+ gold unit, but after I got home from Best Buy, it was still refusing to turn on. Fast forward a few days ago, I ordered a new mobo and cooler because I didn’t wanna deal with the 212 evo again.


So my current specs are


R5 2600
Aorus b450m
Noctua NHU12s Redux
Rx 570 8gb
WD sn550 1tb
Corsair 750w 80+ gold unit
Crucial Ballistix 16gb 3200mhz


And it’s continuing to have the same issue, when I tried hooking up the old psu the fan spins for a short second and then shuts off , and there’s no fan spin at all for the newer one



Some important things to note


I have gone through many, many checklists and none of them worked.

I have completely rebuilt the system multiple times

I have tried with one stick of ram, no luck

I have tried with a different cooler, no luck

The debug lights on my old mobo would flash for a split second to show debug lights, and the lights that would turn on were vga, dram, and boot.


I have tried almost everything. If anyone at all can figure out what’s wrong with my pc that would be great. Thanks."

So i bought this cyberpower computer around november 2020 and since then ive been getting nothing but one problem with it.

The first time a problem happen was the power supply being faulty after like 4 months from buying it. Wasnt too bad so i easily replaced the old power supply which was a 
600w Apevia. The current one thats in my computer is a 650w evga power supply.

The computer was working just fine till like a month ago there was a power outage and this has caused the same problem with my computer ever since. 

It would refuse to turn on just like my old power supply would and ive tried everything to get the computer to work. 

Ive tried replacing the cord. Didnt work.
Ive tried holding down the power button. Didnt work.
Ive even changed the outlet in different places in the house (live in a condo complex) and it STILL didnt work.

So about a week after the power outage i brought it in for repairs and NOW decideds to turn on. I said f*ck it and let them run a full diagnosis on the computer. Stress testing everything to find the problem..and they found nothing. So after i got the computer back...its would run for about 3-6 days before doing the same crap of not turning on.

Ive tried the same methods ive done before and it still doesnt want to turn on but after a day of not touching the computer...I push the power button and decides to turn on again
 
For the pass few weeks now, its been repeating over and over and I am getting annoyed.

I need some help...is it the power supply again? Is my computer not getting power? I need some help. Any help."

I don't know if the wires from the PSU are supposed to be plugged in an specific way and the power isn't flowing right, or what? The fan if pretty much the same, just with a bigger heatsink. Nothing I've tried worked but I've been a little lazy so I haven't tried everything. 

So far I've; Removed one and both RAM sticks, Removed the CMOS battery to reset BIOS and slightly tried fiddling with the wires I just tied. (it's fine. Still like 90 little zip ties left, almost so small that they're not worth the fiddling, but I chose them).

Hi all,

So I came back from vacation recently and discovered that my games had occasional latency spikes despite being connected to Ethernet. After running ping tests/speedtest, it appears that for the most part things run fine, but there are occasional, almost pattern-like spikes in my ping for split seconds. I ran a ping stability test on 'ping.canbeuseful.com' there appears to be regular intervals of spiking. 

Every 10-15 packets sent or so, the ms will spike from 100-115 to 200+

I'm directly connected to my router, and have tried switching cables, ports, etc., but the problem persists. My brother is also connected to the router and he doesn't get the lag and spikes that I do.

Is this an internal hardware issue? And if so, which parts of my computer would likely be responsible?

On the new build there’s only a couple parts I took from the last pc which was the hdd, ssd, and the graphics card, which is a 5700xt. Now I’m aware from other posts I’ve looked at that the drivers for amd gpus are just bad. And I’m not sure what to do now. Whenever it crashes it usually says “graphics driver crashed!” Also usually (but not every time) whenever it crashes, it’s in this weird state where I can’t like X out of anything or bring task manager up to close anything so I end up just having to restart my computer manually. If anyone has any fixes, please let me know, because this is just so frustrating.

techsupport,Function Row Inverted and Windows Key Not Working,"Hey all.

So, I don't know if this is the right place for it, but I'm going insane.

My custom keyboard Epomaker EP84 has been doing great, until I just exited my game of Rocket League. For some reason, my F-Row is all acting as if the Fn key is pressed down, however it isn't. I figured I'd try the Fn lock key to unlock it, but there is none. I've tried every combination I can think of; Fn+F8, F7, Esc, Shift, Caps Lock, Ctrl, Windows, Alt... Nothing.

I know I pressed some random key combination to do this. I don't know what though. I've restarted my PC too. I can't just look at my keyboard and see where the Fn lock is either, because it's a custom keyboard. There is no symbol.

Please help. I just want my F11 to work normal again."

techsupport,FPS/GPU Performance Drops in Multiple Games - New PC,"I've been trying to find the answer for this issue online with no luck, so I thought I'd post it here and see if anyone knows a solution.

I have a 1 yr. old PC with a Gigabyte 3080 10 GB (full build posted at the bottom of this post) and have found this issue across a couple of different games. 

While in-game (Halo Infinite, Horizon Zero Dawn, and COD: Black Ops Cold War to name a few), my GPU performance will suddenly drop and the game will run at 1-2 FPS (the audio and gameplay appear to still be running in the background). **When I click off of the screen or alt+tab into another window, the drop suddenly resolves itself and works as intended.** I first noticed it about at the beginning of December, and it's been getting steadily worse despite my attempts to fix it. 

For Halo, I've decreased my settings to medium and it seems to run more consistently, but it was previously running ultra settings without a problem. I've been running it at 100 FPS, and decreasing it to 60 FPS makes it run more smoothly too, but I still encounter the issue in certain instances.  

The campaign in November worked without any of these issues, so it appeared to be a driver issue when it started in December, but even rolling that back did not fix it. The issues I've been facing always occur in Multiplayer, but I haven't gone back to the campaign to test if that fixes things. It also appears in H:ZD, which is an entirely single-player game. 

I've scanned for viruses using a couple of different virus tools, tried rolling back my drivers, and updated my bios with no change. I am fairly new to the PC world so I haven't been sure how else to diagnose the issue. 

PC Build:

* AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU
* ASUS TUF Gaming X570-Plus Wi-Fi ATX AM4 Motherboard
* G. Skill Ripjaws V Series 32 GB Ram
* Western Digital Blue SN550 1TB M.2 Drive (I also have secondary drives - a 2TB mechanical drive and 1TB M.2 drive)
* Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 10GB Vision
* Corsair CXM 750W 80+ Power Supply

I also use a Viotek 34"" Ultrawide Display - 100 FPS and 1440x3440 resolution - that I haven't ruled out as the problem, but don't really have another monitor to try to troubleshoot. 

Any help or suggestions would be much appreciated!"

techsupport,Display goes black and GPU ramps to 100%,"Please guys I need help!

I recently upgraded my GPU and subsequently my PSU and have now began to run into an issue that seems to occur at random where my displays go black, the GPU fans ramp to 100%, but my computer seems to stay powered on, peripherals still work, and audio still continues.

I originally had a EVGA 3070 FTW3 that was powered by a Corsair SF600 and switched to a Gigabyte Aorus Master 3080 with a Corsair SF750. Since then I have had this issue occur seemingly at random but as far as I recall only happens during gaming (specifically either CoD: Warzone or CoD: Vanguard) but it may have occurred other times I cannot recall. 

I did research on this and have practically tried everything I could find to fix this short of replacing the components. I have ordered another PSU to test this issue but unfortunately I do not have another card. I tried different drivers, undervolting the GPU, changing power limits with Afterburner, different power cables, different ports on my PSU, I have monitored temperatures and confirmed it was definitely not overheating. While gaming full load the GPU reaches around 58c and the processor peaks at 90c.

The one thing I can't really address is my case is very small and this GPU is huge and barely fits and also uses a riser cable to connect to my mobo. I've seen a few instances of people thinking it might possibly be a short but I'm unsure of how to test this. The GPU essentially sits against one of the edges of my case.

techsupport,Few newbie quick questions about internet connection and modem/router setting.,"Hello. I am in progress of setting up properly my internet connection in home after my parents have done that 5 years ago and since then did nothing. I have modem Technicolor CGA2121 to which I want to connect 3 devices (CPU) and a Wi-Fi router. The reason I chose that way is that my modem can process up to 1400 Mbps (I have 600 Mbps connection) and my router has only 300. I do not have spare money to buy new router thus if not necessary I don't want to do it. 

Router has already generated IP adress and works properly, redistributing internet as I have it right now. Problem starts at my attempts to connect other devices. I can not connect to DHCP server, despite having all the Windows 10 settings in place to acquire IP adress and having downloaded newest version of drivers (Realtek PCIe GbE Family Contoller). 

I don't have any CPU connected via ethernet to modem to access [192.168.0.1](https://192.168.0.1) site and check that. All of my connections go through router.  


Is it even possible to do as I plan to? Connect 3 CPU and 1 router?  
What might be the issue in your opinin?   
Can I connect to my modem settings with having router on connection path?  


Thanks for any and all answers in advance. I tried to keep it as informational and short and possible. &lt;3"

2. I also noticed that the Modem is throwing an error of "" **No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out;CM-** "" I googled all I could and I'm assuming this has to do with something on the ISP's end? Or possibly the coax cable that it's connected to? 
3. Packet Loss has been occurring ever since the service was installed a few days ago. The modem has had no issues in the past with packet loss; or as far as I know anyway. I've been connected via ethernet before but completely moved my gaming PC to a different room. I had an external router hooked up and thought that was the problem until I connected directly to the modem and am experiencing the same exact thing.

When I attempt to reset it, it gives me the “There was a problem resetting your PC”. A bit of backstory to provide info, years ago when I was fairly young (perhaps 11 or 12?) I was trying to clear some space on the computer and deleted what I believe to be now some very important things that have now completely messed up the PC’s functionality. My memory isn’t the greatest so that may or may not be the actual reason for the computer’s downfall. 

The computer can not connect to any internet connection and refuses to play sound. Those are the main issues I am aware of. For a long awhile it was stuck on airplane mode until, as of today actually, I went to the administrative controls, then to services, and turned everything to manual/automatic. For reasons I do not know most of the services were disabled and enabling them seemed to only fix a couple things. 

I feel my only choice to revive this PC is to do a hard reset, but it won’t allow me to. It seems to me the reason for that is some crucial files are missing / corrupted. 

I have tried all methods (aside from the system restore point since I did not create one before messing up the pc and the fresh install because I believe I need a key to do that) listed here in the article “How to fix “There was a problem resetting your PC” error on Windows 10” on the website SoftwareKeep.

Because it is actually just a freesync monitor, I am using  ""gsync compatibility"" mode. However, maybe a week or so ago, I updated my graphics drivers from 472.21 to 497.29, and a few days later, my games started to stutter HARD, like maybe a frame a second or two, and the frames were always the same time apart. This first happened on watchdogs legion, then on halo infinite, and then on Cbocw (cold war). This happened a bit in some other games, but not as bad, however I noticed that I never had problems with splitgate. I made sure that my drivers and bios were up to date, which did not fix the problem. I then also checked task manager for my usage, and on call of duty, cpu and gpu were at 30% and 40%ish respectively when my games were stuttering, and then back up to normal usage when it wasnt stuttering. All of these games are on an ssd, and the disk usage was low. When I disabled gsync, or sometimes when i tabbed out then in again, it seemed to fix the problem for a few minutes, but would happen again unless i disabled freesync. What should I do? Edit: I rolled back to the previous driver that I had been using with no issues, and the same thing was Still happening. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I updated my chipset drivers, but I didn't update it until AFTER I started having these problems. I'm not sure if the m32q is listed as gsync compatible, but all of the many reviews I watched before buying the monitor said that it worked fine with gsync.

techsupport,No output on monitor after waking up computer from sleep.... 6800xt - Windows 10 20H2,"I have been dealing with this weird issue since I got a 6800XT about 6 months back, but in short when my computer wakes up from sleep it often (90% of the time) shows no output on my screen (XV340CK P). I had a 3070 before, and this issue happened once in a blue moon, all other specs being the same. When this happens I need to restart the computer manually.

**Specs:**

CPU: 3700X

Mobo: X470 GAMING PRO CARBON (MS-7B78) (AM4)

RAM: G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 64GB (2 x 32GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 3200 (PC4 25600) Intel XMP 2.0 Desktop Memory Model F4-3200C16D-64GVK

GPU: AMD 6800XT (stock)

PSU: XFX XTR 750 W 80+ Gold

Storage: 4 SSDs, 2 HDDs, and 2 NVMes

Monitor: Acer XV340CK P

Windows 10 20H2

The CPU is not OCed, but the RAM is. I've tried different monitors and cables, but they have made no difference. All drivers are up to date. This started happening with the 6800XT, the only thing I could think of is the PSU? Since the 6800XT requires more juice than the 3070, but I believe 750W is more than enough for my system.

Any thoughts?"

techsupport,SSD Freezes on Asus startup Logo Can't access BIOS," Hi Everyone,

My PC was working completely fine for the last 3 years. Then I went on vacation for 1 month, and flicked off the PSU before I left. When I came back and turned the PC back on, it freezes on the Asus logo and I am unable to enter BIOS - regardless of if I am pressing or holding down del/F2.

I took apart the PC, and narrowed it down to the Drive that has Windows 10 on it to be the culprit. All other drives can enter the bios (nothing to boot into though, they are only data drives with documents or games etc).

I have tried a different SATA cable and different power cable (Ones I know that work), but it still freezes.

Is there anything I can do to get this drive booting up again? Any BIOS settings I can change and hook it back up etc? It has documents that I need for work and personal and unfortunately I do not have a backup.

The drive that is causing the issue is a Samsung Evo 850 500gb. It has other files along side Windows 10, and likely few games. But it was no where near full, and was in a ""Healthy"" state according to Samsung's software (with lots of reads and writes left).

My computer Specs are as follows:  
Asus Prime z390-p  
i7-9700k OC 5.0 - Corsair AIO  
4x HyperX Fury 16GB 3000MHz DDR4 CL15 ( 3 of which are unplugged now)  
Asus ROG Strix 2080 (Unplugged)  
EVGA 850 BQ, 80+ BRONZE 850W

Also up to this point, I have cleared the CMOS and checked the connections of everything.

If nothing can be done, is there anyway to get the files?

Thanks."

techsupport,Frame drops in certain games when using OBS or watching videos/twitch on 2nd monitor.,"My mean average FPS is consistant and acceptable at around 100-120 whilst both playing certain games and having OBS open or watching videos/twitch on 2nd monitor. However having OBS open or watching videos/twitch on 2nd monitor in certain games have frequent and vexing frame drops. Currently the only work around I have found is to run the affected games in full screen mode, however this is not ideal, full screen windowed mode is prefered. Different browsers were tested and all yielded the same results (Edge, Chrome, and Firefox).

Attempts to locate posts from others who are having the same or similar issues only suggest that the issue could be due to the inconsistancy between the two display's refresh rates. However after setting identical refresh rates (and colour encoding) on both displays the result is still the same.

This does not affect all games, one of the primary culprits is Destiny 2, although some other games I play are also affected. Halo Infinite for example is not affected.

techsupport,MacBook Air won’t turn on anymore?,"I got a refurbished MacBook Air yesterday. It turned on just fine initially.

I am not 100% sure that all my photos really got deleted, though, as I think I saw that 30/50 gigs were still taken up by my data when I closed it for the night.

This morning, the computer wouldn’t turn on. It had been shut off all night, but was still burning hot for some reason. Now it won’t turn on properly, and here’s what happens when I try using the power button: 1) the screen changes from pitch black to a lighter black/navy, 2) the startup sound occurs, 3) the apple logo lights up on the back of the computer, (but doesn’t show up on the display screen.) The power cord seems to connect just fine and the Mac is no longer hot. 

My roommate was trying to help, and contacted Apple support. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong. She noted through Amazon that we were going to return the Mac, and a few minutes later, it started saying that it’s locked when we view it in iCloud/Find My. This means we cannot remotely erase the Mac from there… which means cannot return it, because it might still have my photos or other personal information. The support website says we can unlock it from Find My, but the “Unlock” button that it supposed to be there is missing. I suspect it’s something to do with the computer being IOS 10.11 El Capitan, but I’m unsure."

At first she was noticing the crashes on Chrome, but after switching to Edge hoping to forget about the issue she began having the same problem. There are no error messages or freezing; the browsers simply force close and she is forced to reopen the application.

She is currently running on Windows 11, with all browsers fully updated. I've done what I can from a hardware perspective (monitoring RAM usage at the moment of crashes and making sure the computer isn't overheating) and everything on that end seems good. She has also uninstalled and reinstalled Chrome several times with no success.

techsupport,Does used storage size affect performance?,"Hi, so it's my understanding that having a drive that's near capacity will cause your computer to run slowly. My question though is does absolute storage matter or just as a percentage of capacity? For example, I have an old macbook 2012 with a 1TB SSD with about 800gb used that runs quite slowly now. (I've updated the ram but I found by far the biggest improvement was moving from a smaller hard drive to this larger SSD a while back). I just received a new macbook 2021 with 2TB SSD. I'm considering doing a time machine import, but I'm concerned that my new laptop will be slow right out of the gate. Is this concern unfounded?

During the scan I saw that the program had detected 60 something or 70 something files. Strangely at the end of the scan, it said it didn't detect anything and basically things were fine. The log showed the same thing.  I also scanned using the full scan option with windows defender and nothing popped up. As one last precaution I scanned using Malwarebytes. Instead of the basic scan I did a custom scan which included root kits and all drives were chosen. 

I initially started scanning yesterday but because it took too long I had to stop it. O started the scan again today but for some reason it took longer. At the 7 hour point it scanned less files than yesterday. Ultimately, I stopped the scan because it was taking too long.

It didn't get any attention which... it was a vague problem but I've narrowed it down and I'm hoping someone can help.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short the color on my monitors would change very frequently. Going to the display settings menu under windows settings would fix it temporarily, but it would change again in 30 minutes or so.

I noticed that WMI provider host was running so I went to event viewer to see what was causing it to run, and NVDisplayContainer is spitting out a lot of errors.

I DDU'D all of my Nvidia drivers, reinstalled, and it didn't fix anything. BUT if I go to task manager and restart Winmgmt (WMI) under services, it fixed the problem completely until I reboot, then I have to do it again.

I don't know what to do about this. I've uninstalled all the drivers twice, including GeForce experience and Nvidia control panel. I've also tried ""just one or the other"" when it comes to those programs and no combination seems to fix it either.

I'm stumped, and I would really appreciate any help, thank you."

Hoping this is the right place to post a query for printers. 

So I recently got a new router with a USB port so that I can use it as a printer server and make my wired USB printer to a wireless one. 

The router is TP Link Archer C1200, I was able to do the necessary stuff and print using my laptop which has the printer driver already installed, so now the printer is wireless for laptops. 

Now the issue is when I try to print using my phone, Google cloud print does not detect the printer. Ricoh's app does not detect via USB OTG nor via wifi Direct. 

There are two apps on Android play store: 

1. Print Share Mobile Print 
2. Print Hand 

Both these apps detected the printer both using USB OTG and wifi Direct but neither of them had the driver for Ricoh SP 210 SU. 

I tried using other model's drivers of Ricoh, generic drivers of Ricoh and other companie's generic drivers but was still not able to test print any document. 

I think I have exhausted all options and there is no way for me able to print documents using my android phone/tablets and will have to use my laptop each time.

This is a prebuilt ibuypower system, and it has been great for the near year I have owned it. The issue started recently and suddenly. Whenever the system is loading up a game, or even loading webpages, installing software, it will make what I can only describe as a grinding/buzzing noise. The closest thing I can compare it to, for those who remember is the noises computers used to make a long time ago when loading a web page on an old dial up connection. Also, the CPU troubleshooting LED on the motherboard will turn on and off randomly while making the noise. At first, I thought a fan was catching on something, but I have individually stopped each fan in the system while the noise was occurring, and that did not stop the noise. The GPU fans aren't even running most of the time, but when they do kick on, it doesn't coincide with the noise. I'm at a bit of a loss here and not sure what to look at. I have watched the system in afterburner, and all CPU cores register and show as being used. Temps on the CPU under load were at the highest 90. So I'm not sure what to make of this. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated."

techsupport,"""Check Bluetooth radio status"" says fixed but audio is still cutting out every 10 ish seconds every time I reconnect headphones to pc. Running troubleshooter fixes issue until reconnecting headphones again later.","So every time I connect my bluetooth headphones they will cut out every 10 ish seconds or suddenly have a delay in audio of about a second behind. I have fixed this every time by running the windows bluetooth troubleshooter and it will say ""Check Bluetooth radio status&gt;Fixed"" and work fine for a while.

If I reconnect the headphones then I have to do it again every time. I have to run the troubleshooter every time I connect them to my pc and it will be fine for a decade if I never disconnect them, but the moment I restart the headset or pc I have to run it again to fix the issue as it INSTANTLY comes back after doing so. It says fixed every time too and I have tried everything Google has shown me and even contacted support and talked for an hour but even they couldn't fix it. It does this to every bluetooth headset I have, old or new so I know it isn't just this one specifically.

I have updated all of my bluetooth drivers, updated my pc and all optional updates, gone to device manager and deleted my bluetooth drivers and reinstalled them, disabled all enhancements and turned off handsfree telephony per each device. I might've missed a few things that I've done as well since I have been at this for 2 weeks and I am tired of googling everything and asking support who doesn't seem to know what is going on with the solutions that I am getting and following through with. No quick fixes, I want a full fix so I can just connect and do my work and not run a process every time since I sometimes have to run it multiple times per hour and it adds up to so much time just running the fix.

Then I got to the windows firewall and it says ""potentially unwanted app found. Your device may perform poorly."" then I enter the virus &amp;threat protection in the windows firewall and it says: ""threats found. Start the recommended actions"" but then it presents no recommended actions?? I ran a full scan and it returned no results. So basically the firewall tells me some unwanted app or a threat is on the computer, but it won't tell me where or what it is? Anyone heard of this before? any easy way to get rid of it?

TL;DR: Random song or ad starts playing from out of nowhere, Firewall says there are threats but can't show them to me.

After that, somehow I forgot about it / the thing was lost / I never actively did anything again on my various computers (and I changed several times) to re-sync it.

I assumed it either never synced again after that or maybe the Time Machine was just permanently turned off and lost.

But today I was checking out Activity Monitor and saw this:

[https://imgur.com/a/JzSMis7](https://imgur.com/a/JzSMis7)

Why is Time Machine listed under the Energy tab as ""Applications in last 12 hours""? 

1. Does that mean my current computer is syncing with Time Machine?
2. If so: Does that happen automatically because I did it once 10 years ago, or would someone have to actively do something to make my computer sync now? 
3. Does the physical Time Machine object (not sure how else to describe lol) have to be powered on for my computer to be syncing?

(Context: I think the Time Machine is currently in possession of a nosy family member with a history of full-blown stalking, and I am wondering if it is *possible* they have been e.g. keeping it on all this time so it syncs with my computers, and ""restoring"" their own computer from my backups to see my stuff?

techsupport,I bought a clearance demo monitor and the screen is messed up unless the refresh rate is lowered to 100hz or less.,"So I bought an Acer XZ242Q 144hz demo model for super cheap from a store and when I plugged it into my computer the screen was almost all vertical lines aside from the top quarter inch.

I decided to give fixing it one more go and upon lowering the refresh rate to 60hz at first, then gradually raising it to 100hz, I found that the monitor works perfectly fine at those refresh rates. 

I have an AMD 6600XT graphics card that was recently installed and am using the DisplayPort cable from my previous monitor. I'm not too well versed on the capabilities of different cable protocols but I feel like maybe an updated DisplayPort cable might be what I need. Or maybe there is a driver update that doesn't seem to want to come though. Or maybe I should just return the monitor as a 100hz 1080p monitor isn't something I'd be interested in keeping.

Memory (RAM): 2x BALLISTIX 32GB DDR4 3600 Mhz w/XMP
Motherboard: Z490 AORUS PRO AX
Power supply: Corsair RM850x 80 Plus Gold 


Problem description

The computer ran for 5 months under Ubuntu 20.04 without problems in continuous operation until it is frozen at once.
Image was still present, however, entering through the mouse or Keyboard without any responding.

After a restart the problem has not been solved and the computer freezes arbitrarily.
Also when I start from a live USB operating system I'm facing the same issue.
A specific application that forces the computer to freeze does not seem to exist and it happens sometimes in very short intervals (1-2 minutes) and sometimes the computer also runs through days. But the problem will definitely come up again sooner or later.

I only connected the following:

Mouse
Keyboard
Monitor (internal hdmi)
LAN

I have already taken the following steps to find the problem

BIOS Update
Ubuntu newly installed/updated (the operating system or on the disk doesn't seems to be the problem)
Memory tested (memtest86 ran threw without error)
Memory individually installed and tested in different slots
XMP on/off
logs (but unfortunately it seems that the computer is no longer able to write messages away when the error occurs)

Now I almost assume that it is either the CPU or the motherboard itself.
Do you have any idea what else could be tested or might be the problem?

Thank you in advance!

techsupport,Preinstalled Windows - Am I being paranoid ?,"Hello all ! 

So I bought a new Intel NUC from Amazon, I did not want to bother with hardware installation so I found one with preinstalled HDD / RAM and Windows.

The seller is not Amazon, but hey that's the case for a lot of products so I did not worry (+ that was eligible to Amazon Premium)

I bought this : Intel NUC 11 Pro **NUC11PAHi5** Home &amp; Business Desktop Mini PC，Intel® Core™ i5-1135G7 4-Core, 2.4 GHz–4.2 GHz Turbo，8 Thread, 8MB Cache,16GB RAM, 512GB PCIe SSD, 28W Intel® Iris™ X Graphics, Win 10 Pro

I received it today and there was no user manual for OS installation, so I went on Intel website to check it out.

It seems INTEL don't sell Windows with their NUC.

Ok, I suppose the seller did sell me a Windows with the HDD &amp; RAM in addition to the kit (because the NUC11PAHi5 is a kit a not a mini PC).

So then, I started wondering about that.

I looked at the selling company, it's located in China, I find no real info on the Internet. Also I did not find any Windows licence number anywhere, it's been a long time since I last bought Windows, so I don't know maybe it's normal.

I turned the device on and it went to the Windows installation process.

So now I'm starting being a little paranoid :

* Is all this 100% legit and clean?
* Do I already have malwares on my computer and will be going to be tracked by someone in CHina?
* Is the computer going to do stuff it's not supposed to be?

What do you think? Should I already fully format the HDD ? What about Windows then? It will be lost?

Thanks for your advices !"
techsupport,"Very strange computer problem, computer will blackscreen for a few seconds when the smallest vibration or bump happens.","Computer specs: Skytech Shiva prebuilt with 3060ti, ryzen 5 5600x, b550 motherboard, computer is sitting on the floor (carpet) which is relevant to my issue somewhat. 

So basically my problem is exactly what I described. Any form of ""disturbance"", including hitting my desk with medium force, stomping or even stepping heavily next to the tower, sitting down in my chair hard, or tapping the case itself, even lightly, will all cause the computer to blackscreen for a few seconds. What will happen exactly is that the screen will freeze for about one second and in this second there will be strange things like random colors where they aren't supposed to be before the monitor acts like it has lost input and the screen will go black for a 5(ish) seconds and then will come back on. When it comes back on there will be other problems as well, such as discord specifically kind of breaking visually and not really displaying correctly (hard to describe) and will have to be restarted to come back on. However this does not happen 100% of the time. Also, League of Legends will crash and tell me I have a driver error (this is obviously not the actual problem). 

The way these errors happen I am almost completely certain that this is some sort of error with my graphics card but I do not know how to fix it. The only other examples of this problem I have found are forum post from many years ago and have not been helpful. I have tried things like switching the HDMI cable but that didn't work, I also tried taking the graphics card out and putting it back in incase it was seated in the motherboard incorrectly. I did not take anything like the PCI-E cables out, I only took the card out of the motherboard and reseated it. This actually made the problem more or less go away, then it came back a few hours later but was not as bad as it was originally, and now after a day or two it is just as bad as it was originally. 

I hope someone has any idea what is going on and can help I would really appreciate it, thank you."

techsupport,How dangerous PUAs are?,"Hi, I'm am not sure whether this is a proper sub to ask my question, but I would like to know how dangerous are PUA: Win32/Softonic and PUA:Win 32/InstallCore.R and what could they do to my PC? I am worried that somebody could gain access to my data. 

Windows Defender found them on my PC after full scanning which lasted over 2 hours even though my computer has good parameters. It didn't find them during fast scanning. 

My computer performaned quite normally (sometimes a little bit slowly).

Thanks in advance for help"
techsupport,Corsair PWM Repeater Issues,"I have 6 fans connected to the PWM repeater in a Corsair 5000D Airflow, and they constantly run at 100%. All of the fans are PWM compatible, and other fans connected to other headers can be controlled via bios and software.

CPU\_FAN - CPU cooler

CHA\_FAN1 - Single Corsair LL140

CHA\_FAN2 - Corsair PWM repeater, with 6PWM fans connected.

CHA\_FAN 3 - Single Corsair LL120

Any ideas?

I'm thinking 3 things to test next: possible CHA\_FAN2 header bad (unlikely), PWM repeater does not like having different types of fans connected (don't see why it would matter just for a repeater, and I will try a different fan on header 1 of the repeater to see if that changes anything.

Thanks all!"

techsupport,PC won't boot/ stay on,"I am trying to get my pc to boot. I am currently running an AMD 5800x with the B550 Aorus Pro V2.

I've tried two different BIOS versions, newest and then the previous version. I flash the BIOS, the PC boots. Then about 2 minutes later it shuts down. After it shuts down, the PC won't boot again. So it seems the BIOS is taking, but then fails after a few minutes.   

The CMOS jumper isn't in/on, the two pins are clear. 

Any and all help would be appreciated."
techsupport,Playlists on SD card for VW Golf,"I posted about this issue in the VW [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Volkswagen/comments/rz0a6g/playlists_on_sd_card_golf_sportwagen_4motion_18/) and on other platforms but I am not getting any answers. I have called multiple dealerships, my local mechanic shop and VW Canada.

Their only suggestions is that I bring my car in for diagnostics.

I wanted to know if anyone was able to successfully use a m3u playlist file on an SD card. When I access the playlist I get a message ""No playable files available""

I am following the requirements outlined in the infotainment manual for my car.

I am using a Sandisk 256gb SDXC card (SDSDUN4-256G-GN6IN)

SD card format is ExFAT

All songs are in MP3

Playlist format is M3U

Playlist file size is under 20kb, I only have 18 songs in this playlist.

File name and path is under 256 characters.

Below is my current playlist structure.

#EXTM3U

#EXTINF:214,Let's Get Started - Mungo Jerry

Music/Mungo Jerry/Unknown Album/Let's Get Started.mp3

#EXTINF:239,Borriquito - Peret

Music/Peret/Unknown Album/Borriquito.mp3

#EXTINF:307,Master Blaster (Jammin') - Stevie Wonder

Music/Stevie Wonder/Unknown Album/Master Blaster (Jammin').mp3

#EXTINF:265,English Man In New York - Sting

Music/Sting/Unknown Album/English Man In New York.mp3

#EXTINF:268,Spanish Guitar \[Radio Mix\] - Toni Braxton

Music/Toni Braxton/Spanish Guitar (The Remixes) - single (2000)/01 Spanish Guitar \[Radio Mix\].mp3

&amp;#x200B;

I am almost certain the issue is with the playlist file structure. Thank you.

techsupport,Unable to install windows store ubuntu apps (error 0x80070005),"Hello, I've been trying to install Linux (via the Windows Store) onto my Windows PC for hours in order to setup NextCloud to use as a Google Drive alternative, but haven't been able to install Ubuntu, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, or Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. I enabled the Linux windows file subsystem or whatever it's called and spent about 45 minutes changing permissions of folders to allow full control to anything that even resembled something having to do with ubuntu.

I'm extremely new to Linux, so I honestly have very little clue as to what I'm doing in the first place. I just know that every time I try to run the ubuntu2004.exe file (In the WindowsApps folder in Program Files) it returns the following:

    Installing, this may take a few minutes... WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x80070005 Error: 0x80070005 Access is denied.  Press any key to continue... 

I've searched google for the fix to this as well, but all I can find are threads where someone comments a rather complex solution and then the thread is terminated for inactivity

I'd appreciate any help you guys can offer, thanks!"

techsupport,Extremely Slow Nitro 5 Windows 11 21H2 w/ Seagate Cuda Hybrid Drive,"I bought this PC in April 2020. About a week after I bought it I replaced to original hard drive with a Cuda Hybrid Drive and had noticeably faster performance. Within a year I started seeing a significant slowdown that has progressively gotten worse. Sometimes it takes 5 minutes to open up my Webbrowser or open a single folder in File Explorer and is prone to crashing. Currently my hard drive has 512 GB of free space. Task manager consistently show 97-100% disk use even when no other apps are running. 

I have tried all of the following with no improvements
 
Rebooting
Virus scan
Updating Windows 10 
Upgrading to Windows 11
Disk defragmentation 
Clearing temporary files
Closing unnecessary start up and background programs 
Running sfc scannow 
Stopping  sysmain 
Disabling windows search 
Fixing broken regestry items
Fixing broken shortcuts 
Updating  all drivers

I also tried booting from the original hard drive with the same problems 

What else could I do?"
